One week after the most notorious and sophisticated kidnap kingpin was arrested and paraded in Lagos, Chukwudi Dumeme Onuamadike, a.k.a Evans, on Sunday led a team of Policemen from the Federal Anti-kidnapping Unit to two detention camps where he used to keep his abductees until ransom are paid.

The two separate buildings were located at Igando and Ikotun respectively.

National Daily gathered that Evans used the two houses he rented as detention camps where the kidnap victims are kept for days or months while negotiation for ransom are been perfected.



Worried by his present status, he called on other kidnappers still perpetrating the act to refrain, admonishing them to chose a profession that will not bring the shame

“As you are looking or watching me. Stop kidnapping people that will bring disgrace to you when you are caught.”

Evans was arrested on June 10, along with six suspected top members of his gang at Magodo Estate in Lagos where he lived in mansion few days after he had relocated his family to Ghana.


He was arrested by the Joint Special Forces led by the Intelligence Response Team, the Lagos State Police Command’s Anti-Kidnapping Unit and Technical and Intelligent Unit of the Force led by Abba Kyari.
