He stressed that the need to have instant continued access to the Internet had resulted in a higher demand by customers for data to be easily accessible at affordable rates.
The new device and bonus offers give customers great value and rewards them for their usage. The offers can be accessed via online shop at smile.com.ng, Smile shops and authorised distributors spread across the cities that they operate.
