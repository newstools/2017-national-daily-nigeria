A serving Lance Corporal Victor Chukwunonso of the Nigerian Army has been arrested as a member of the notorious kidnap kingpin, Evans, who was arrested in Magodo a couple of weeks ago.

National Daily learnt that the soldier before his arrest on Friday by the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), was a member of the Nigeria Army Band Corps.

Chukwudidumeme Onuamadike, aka Evans, was believed to have recruited the soldier, with service number (09/NA/64/6317), into its fold as a protective arsenal but luck ran out of him as he was arrested around 8pm, in Ojo area of Lagos state.

He was said to have been picked up as a result of Evans’ confession after the arrest of his other six gang members in his Magodo GRA mansion.

According to him, he had followed Evans for kidnapping in Lagos state on three occasions. He said he has earned about N6.5m so far.




However, serious efforts to arrest his (Evans) other gang members is going on.

Attempt to reach the 81 Division, Nigerian Army spokesman, Lt. Col. Olaolu Dauda to confirm the authenticity of the arrest if he was actually a serving military man was not successful as a text message sent to him was not responded to.
