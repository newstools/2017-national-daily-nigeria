Fresh facts have emerged on how operatives of the Lagos State Police command were able to smash a notorious robbery suspect who had been terrorizing traders and buyers at the popular Alaba International Market in Ojo area of Lagos State
 
National Daily visited the market at the weekend and in its course of investigation, it was learnt that the suspect had been operating within the past five years as a one-man squad, stealing money running into millions of naira from those coming to purchase goods at the market and also from shops of importers and other traders in the market.
 
Investigation revealed that nemesis finally caught up with him after a smart person had taken his picture with a mobile phone when he was snatching a bag containing phones and some cash from a victim.
 
The whistleblower sent the picture to the police who in turn spent some months to monitor the suspect and eventually trail him to a hideout where he engaged the police team in gun duel. In the process, he had gunshot wounds, and later confessed to the crime and claimed to be the mastermind of all the major robbery and theft that has been occurring in the market.

A businessman in the market,  Kenneth Obinna who spoke to National Daily on security issues at the market thanked the Lagos Police Commissioner (CP) Fatai Owoseni and his operatives for their effort that led to the killing of the notorious armed robber.
 
He further urged the Lagos police to comb the market on weekly basis because there are still criminals coming into the market pretending to be traders whereas they are not.
 
According to him, some traders who are new to the various intrigues at the market still fall victim to these bad elements who either swindle them or rob them as they approach to enter the market when they suspect the individual is carrying cash.
