A man has been arrested at the Aflao Border Post for allegedly attempting to traffic two Ghanaian girls through the Togo border to board a flight to Saudi Arabia.
The suspect, 35-year old Utham Nasir Ismail, was apprehended by immigration officers, who also rescued the 19-and-21-years-old women. National Daily gathered that Ismail had claimed to be a trader who buys Woodin clothes and ginger to sell in Nigeria from Ghana.
