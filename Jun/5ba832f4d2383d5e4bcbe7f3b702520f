A woman, Adebisi, on Wednesday urged an Agege Customary Court, Lagos, to dissolve her 10-year-old marriage to her husband, Olatunji Abiodun. She told the court that part of her problems with her husband was his decision to give their daughter tribal marks without her consent.
She alleged that her husband had told her he was taking their daughter on a visit to his parents but brought her back with tribal marks.
Adebisi, who  had on March 31, 2016, approached the court seeking the dissolution of the marriage, also said the husband was unfaithful and irresponsible.

The President of the court, Phillips Williams, who gave the verdict, said the marriage had broken down irretrievably.
Abiodun had earlier told the court that her husband for 10 years had been harassing her everywhere. She described her husband as a drunkard and as a secret cult member.
Olatunji, a middle-aged man and a father of two, also consented to the dissolution of the marriage. He alleged that the petitioner was not submissive and lacked manners, saying she does not dress like a married woman, but liked skimpy clothes.
