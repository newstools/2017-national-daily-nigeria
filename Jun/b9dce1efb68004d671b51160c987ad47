The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) led school children and other stakeholders on a sensitisation road walk against drug abuse and trafficking in Ikorodu.

The walk is part of seven days activities to commemorate  the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking .

The commander of the NDLEA, Lagos state command, Ahlaji Aliyu Sule, who led stakeholders during the walk, said it was aimed at creating more awareness on the dangers of substance abuse.

“The agency seeks to create more awareness concerning drug abuse and illicit trafficking. Many people die on daily basis while others are referred to psychiatric hospitals ” if you abuse drug,drug will abuse you”, he said.

The 2017 theme for the commemoration of the World Drug Day is Listen First.
The commander said parents can help save a life from illicit drug use by their wards if only they could listen more and seek help for children before they hooked on drugs.

According to him ,over 16000 tonnes of drugs were seized in 2016 in  Lagos state alone while 460 suspects arrested and 200 cases of drugs abuse still in court .

His Royal Highness  Adewale Shotobi  commended the effort of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).
