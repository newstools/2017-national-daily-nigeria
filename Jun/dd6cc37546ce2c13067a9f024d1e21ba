No fewer than two persons were  reportedly injured in a renewed dispute between Aguleri, the home town of Governor Willie Obiano, and neighbouring Umueri – both in Anambra East Local Government Area of Anambra State.

It was gathered that the fight ensued following a land purchase by a business man from Aguleri people. When the man went to start developing the place, Umueri youths refused, saying the property encroached on their land.

In reaction to the action taken by Umueri people, Aguleri youths mobilised with weapons of war to the area and torched the building.

When the traditional ruler of Umueri, Igwe Benneth Emeka, was contacted, he said one building was torched, while the injured were not much.

He said there has not been any recorded death and that the situation had been brought under control by a team of security operatives.

The leaders of the two communities with the help of the Obiano administration had entered into series of meetings to finally resolve the imbroglio.

National Daily reports that the crisis between the Umueri and Aguleri began since 1999 and ended in 2002, claiming a lot of lives with property worth millions of naira destroyed. The land dispute was however quelled following the intervention of then president Olusegun Obasanjo.

Though the Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Samuel Okaula, described the situation as under control, adding that no lives were lost.

It was gathered that the situation had heightened tension in the area with the Joint Task Force (JTF) team of the military, police and others stationed in the two communities
