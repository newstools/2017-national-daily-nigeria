Two employees of Shoprite Retail Supermarket Limited were on Tuesday arraigned for allegedly stealing N1.4 million from their employer in Lagos.

The accused, Moses Adeyemi,19, and Rasheed Naasir, 37, reside at No. 23, Patey St., Lagos Island and Lekki Beach Road, Jakande, respectively.

They were arraigned at the Igbosere Magistrates’ Court on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing.

“The accused diverted money paid by customers through Point of Sale (POS) Terminals into their personal accounts, rather than their employer’s account.

“They used a special code to transfer the money to their accounts without the knowledge of the company,” he said.

Akpene said that the offences contravened Sections 287 (7) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.

However, the accused pleaded not guilty to the two- count charge and were granted bail.

The Magistrate, Mrs S.K. Matepo, granted the first accused bail in the sum of N500, 000, but admitted the second accused to bail in the sum of N200, 000; both with two sureties in like sum.

The magistrate later adjourned the case to July 10 for mention.
