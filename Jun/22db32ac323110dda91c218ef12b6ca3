DHL Express at its annual DHL Employee Appreciation Week, an employee engagement initiative held recently, attributed its success in Nigeria to the contribution by members of its workforce across the country.
This year, the Africa-wide initiative was run in the month of June in over 50 countries impacting over 4,000 employees.
Vice President, Human Resources, DHL Express Sub Saharan Africa, Paul Clegg said while the focus at the event was on fun, it was meant to recognise and reward its team across Africa, who made it possible for the company to deliver excellence to its customers.
He added: “One of Deutsche Post DHL Group’s three bottom lines is to be the ‘Employer of Choice’, so our efforts are focused on creating a great place to work. We believe how we think influences what we say and do and the only way to maintain our ‘Insanely Customer Centric Culture’ is if we have highly motivated, well-trained, emotionally-engaged and happy employees.”

In Deloitte’s, 2017 Global Human Capital Trends, it is shown that while employee engagement is increasingly being recognised across the globe as an integral component to business success, relatively few companies have begun to build programs, strategies and teams that understand and continuously improve employee engagement.
On top of recommending taking a proactive role in understanding and improving employee experience in the company, especially those that operate in competitive global economies—like DHL Express—the study also suggests that pushing out these engagement programs and strategies is becoming increasingly vital to business bottom-lines. This is because when companies succeed in attracting and retaining skilled employees, these employees will in turn provide excellent customer experiences.
