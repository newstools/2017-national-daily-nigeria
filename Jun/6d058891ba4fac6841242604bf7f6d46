The Minister said tobacco is currently responsible for the death of about 6 million people annually across the world with 80% of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries like Nigeria.
“This includes about 600,000 people who are also estimated to die from the effects of second-hand smoke. Many of these deaths occur prematurely.” he noted.
He added that the government, in its fight against tobacco, has inaugurated the National Tobacco Control Committee, NATOCC.
The committee is expected to produce a draft of the National Tobacco Control Regulations 2017 which would be sent to the National Assembly for approval.
