Sixty units of armoured vehicles would soon arrive the Tin-Can Island Port (TCIP), Apapa from Jordan, Minister of Defence, General Mansur Dan-Ali (rtd), has said.
Dan-Ali stated this weekend while receiving 25 units of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Armoured vehicles from the United Arab Emirate (UAE).
Similarly, the Minister who was accompanied by the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman and the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, also received the visiting Indian Navy Ship, INS Tarkash (Vanguard of Victory) at the Tin-Can Island Port.

While commending the management of the NPA for their continuous support and seamless synergy with government, especially with the quick clearance of the vehicles, he said the military hardware were meant to further checkmate the remnants of Boko Haram in the northern eastern axis of the nation.
Dan-Ali said though the insurgents have largely been defeated, the four-wheel drive vehicles would further help to push them out of their various hideouts, revealing that 60 more of the armoured vehicles will arrive the Tin-Can Island Port, Apapa in a few months from Jordan.
The Indian warship commanded by Capt. Rituraj Sahu is visiting Nigeria on a routine military exercise.
Also, aboard the vessel beside several Indian Naval Officers and ratings was the Head of Mission, Capt. Guatam Marwaha, who said the warship would sail to Angola, with June 8, 2017 as the expected date of arrival.
