The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), has launched the final billing and customer portal modules of Revenue Invoice Management System (RIMS) as part of effort in improving customer service delivery in port operations.

Speaking at the launching recently in Lagos, Managing Director of NPA, Hadiza Bala Usman, said that the launch was aimed at further repositioning the agency’s improved operational efficiency, adding that the development will continue to improve the Single Window project that is being undertaken in collaboration with the Nigeria Customs Service, Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and other agencies of government.
 
She noted that the platforms are also fully integrated with all existing solutions like Oracle Financials, Oracle human capital management, NPA pay direct via interswatch and Electronic Ship Entry Notice (eSEN).
 
According to Usman, the introduction of the system will improve the agency’s service offering, improve partner relationship, create efficient payment method, maximize revenue and eradicate loss associated with fraud and revenue leakages.
 
“The portal which is a web based application will strengthen our internal processes through instant data submission, speed up processes by way of automation and enhance the provision of a link to all stakeholders.”

She added that the platforms fully integrate the real time streams of electronic flow of information for business – to customer and business-to business with higher availability and flexible architecture.
 
Speaking earlier, the Executive Director, Finance and Administration of the authority, Mr. Mohammed Bello Koko, said RIMS was introduced in order to improve efficiency, accuracy, completeness and block leakages in the system with the ultimate aim to increase revenue and leakages.
 
“It is important to note that all over the world any new system will encounter some challenges at initial stage but we believe that with the application of learning curve theory in using the applications, you will build strong confidence level”, he said.
