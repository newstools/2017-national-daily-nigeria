One year after she buried her husband, wife of late Nigerian singer Nomoreloss, Adeola Phoenix Osinuga, is battling a chronic disease called fibromyalgia. A chronic disease that has kept her in constant daily pain and kept her away from her radio job with Rhythm FM.
Sharing photos on social media, Adeola Phoenix Osinuga wrote of her battle:‘I can almost open my own pharmacy at this rate. Sometimes, you need painkillers for the pain caused by going to the hospital for painkillers.’‘(Sigh) when I think about the amount of chocolates I could buy with this money instead of buying medicine.’ On March 21 2016, mother of two, Adeola had lost her late husband, Nomoreloss few weeks after he was diagnosed of Typhoid Fever.
