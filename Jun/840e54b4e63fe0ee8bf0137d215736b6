36-year-old Henry Asuquo,  who allegedly raped his 15-year-old step sister has been granted N1 million bail by a Tinubu Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, on Wednesday.
The defendant, a security guard, who resides at Saint Saviour Street, Sura, Lagos Island, is facing a two-count charge of rape and sexual harassment.
The prosecutor, Nurudeen Thomas, told the court that the offences were committed between March, 2013 and June, 2017 at the apartment of the accused.
He said that the victim  who shares the same maternal roots with Thomas was brought in from the village since she was five to stay with her half brother.
He alleged that the accused had been sexually assaulting the girl since she was 11 years.
“The accused had been sexually assaulting the girl on different occasions whenever his wife was not around, raping her and having anal sex with her.
“When the girl started approaching adolescence, she started fighting back; since then the accused would beat her to a pulp for any slight mistake.
“On June 11, when he tried raping her again, the 15-year-old grabbed his scrotum.
