Samuel Aminu, 28, a student of the Nassarawa State College of Arts and Basic Studies, NACABS has been locked behind bars over alleged certificate forgery.
Aminu, who was arraigned before a  Jos Upper Area Court, was said to have committed the offence on Nov 11, 2016.
According to the prosecutor, Yakubu Audu, the accused had some unresolved issues in school which made it impossible for him to graduate.
“Since he could not graduate, he forged statement of result of the institution and has been using it to parade himself as a graduate of NACABS,” the prosecutor said.
He told the court that Aminu proceeded to Success Business School in Jos to further his education where he presented the forged document.
“He applied for Higher National Diploma in Business Administration and was apprehended at the point of verification of the certificate before registration,” Audu noted.
The 28-year-old pleaded not guilty to the charge leveled against him.
The Magistrate, Yahaya Mohammed however, ordered his detention.
He adjourned the case till June 22 to enable the police carry out further investigation.
