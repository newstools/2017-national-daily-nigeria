“It is also necessary to focus on improving the ease of doing business through regulatory reforms to lower costs, eliminate bottlenecks and improve administrative processes,” he added.

Continuing, he noted, that the company’s Profit After Tax(PAT), negatively impacted by revaluation of Forex loans due to the devaluation of the naira.

A review of the company’s result for the period ended December 31, 2016 showed that the company’s PAT dipped from N23.74 billion in the same period in 2015 to N7.92 billion the current year.
