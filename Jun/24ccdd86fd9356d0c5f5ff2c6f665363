The Ekiti State Government has disbursed over N1 billion housing and car loans to workers in the state public service since the inception of the Ayodele Fayose administration about two and a half years ago.

The State Head of Service (HOS), Dr. Olugbenga Faseluka, revealed this in Ado-Ekiti on Monday, highlighting that over N413.18 million was disbursed as housing loans, while N696.87 million was disbursed to 2,997 workers during the period under review.

According to the HOS, while the housing loans were disbursed in tranches, the car loans which range from N80,000 to N1.5 million depending on the beneficiary’s salary grade levels, were disbursed in full to the benefiting workers.

Faseluka added that Governor Fayose  recently approved the integration of the workers in the state public service into the National Housing Funds (NHF) with effect from January this year as part of efforts at ensuring workers in the state have houses of their own.

He disclosed that the state government has already acquired 20 hectares of land opposite the Obasanjo Estate along Ikere Road, Ado Ekiti, for the takeoff of the staff housing scheme which would be financed by the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria.
