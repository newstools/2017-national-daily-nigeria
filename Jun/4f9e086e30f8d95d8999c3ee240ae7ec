The registrar has said that the UTME exam has been rescheduled for 1st of July.
 
“We also cancelled the results of 57,646 candidates who were involved in malpractices across centres. Hence, we have rescheduled the UTME for those candidates and others who have biometric and other technical issues. We also approved Saturday, July 1, for the rescheduled examination. The board has, moreover, suspended 24 Computer-Based Test centres for one year due to technical issues. These centres would not participate in the 2018 UTME,” he said.
