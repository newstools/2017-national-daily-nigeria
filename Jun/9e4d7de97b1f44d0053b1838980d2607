Ekiti Gov. Ayodele Fayose has boasted that he is the speaker of the House of Assembly.



The governor made the boast today while addressing citizens of the state at a ceremony to commemorate his third anniversary in office.



While introducing Kola Oluwawole, Speaker of the Assembly, Fayose said that he was the person directly in charge of the state’s legislature. He pointed the microphone in the direction of Oluwawole and asked him to confirm his claim; Oluwaole responded, “Yes, you are.”

Fayose pointed out that in other south western states, it was only in Ekiti State that all elective positions are being held by members of the Peoples Democratic Party.

“I am the Speaker of the house of assembly,” he said. “I am the speaker. Anyone who doesn’t like it should go and perish.

“Any opposition, we take it out. That other one too is going unpopular. That other one [the former speaker], we cannot glorify him by mentioning his name.”

Fayose also that the investigation into the Ikoyi cash claimed by the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), which was discovered by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has since been swept under the carpet.
