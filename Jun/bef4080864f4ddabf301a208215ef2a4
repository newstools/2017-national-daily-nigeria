Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike aka Evans, has again slammed a N300 million suit against the Nigerian police and three others before a Federal High Court in Lagos over his alleged illegal detention.
The new suit, which was filed on Thursday, also demands compensation for an unconstitutional media trial and exemplary damages.
Others included the suit are, the Inspector General of Police, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police and the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, Lagos State Police Command.
Evans had on June 28 filed an ex parte application with reference number FHC/L/CS/1012/2017, before the same court, seeking an order directing the respondents to charge him to court.
He had also in the alternative sought an order directing the respondents to release him unconditionally where no charge is preferred against him.

In an affidavit deposed to by Evan’s father, Stephen Onwuamadike, it was averred that the applicant has been subjected to media trial without any court order by the respondents.
Onwuamadike further averred that the media trial and news orchestrated by the respondents have continued to generate reactions in both print and electronic media without his son being afforded fair hearing before a court of law.
Evans contended that his continued detention by the respondents since June 10, without a charge, or release on bail, is an infringement on his fundamental rights.
No date has been fixed for hearing in his latest suit.
