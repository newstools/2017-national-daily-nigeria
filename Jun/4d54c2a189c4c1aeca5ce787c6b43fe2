Nnamdi Kanu, separatist leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra ((IPOB), has urged his members and other eligible voters in Anambra State to boycott the state gubernatorial election slated for November.
Kanu is seeking people shun the poll except the federal government conducts a referendum before the election.
“Nigerian government should build as many prisons as possible to jail all Biafrans because there is no going back and we are ready to go there (prisons) unless the federal government gives us Biafra.
“We are starting with Anambra come November this year. There will be no governorship election in Anambra State. In 2019, the whole of Biafra land will not vote for any President. There will be no Senator, there will be no House of Reps, there will be no House of Assembly and there will be no councillorship elections in Biafra land if they (federal government) fail to call for a referendum.”

He urged his members to remain steadfast and calm as Biafra remains their only hope.
“We are not like any other people. People like us don’t come twice. That’s why I know that with the last breath in this very body that Biafra will be restored. There’s nothing anybody can do about it. Tell them that’s what I said. Nobody on this earth can stop Biafra,” he added.
