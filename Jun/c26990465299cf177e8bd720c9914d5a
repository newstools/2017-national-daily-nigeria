Quantum Global Research Lab has advised the Federal Government (FG) of Nigeria to ensure the protection of concessionaires’ rights in the current review of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) policy framework.

The Managing Director (MD) of Quantum Global Research Lab, Mthuli Ncube advised at the launch of the Africa Investment index held in Lagos, recently.

“Protecting the rights of concessionaires within those concessions is also critical within that PPP arrangement. I think there are some principles that need to be in place that brings comfort to foreign investors is what is really required,” he said.

“It is about the nitty-gritty of protecting concessionaires within the concession arrangement. They should just make it easy for foreign investors to negotiate concessions,” he continued.

Ncube further noted that government’s investment in infrastructure is key in attracting foreign investments in the country.

Moreover, the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun had earlier  at a roundtable conference for CEOs held in Lagos, recently, said the FG would be reviewing the PPP policy framework to address issues in the policy aimed at attracting more investors to the arrangement.

This review is coming on the heels of a clarion call on the government to review the legal framework of the PPP to ensure sustainable development.
