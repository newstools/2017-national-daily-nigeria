The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), has said that the failure of the prosecution to present witnesses in the alleged offence against Senate President, Bukola Saraki made their (CCT) evidence “incurably defective”.
Saraki was slammed with a 13-count charge of false assets declaration by the federal government, shortly after his emergence as Senate president in September 2015.
But on Wednesday, the tribunal cleared and acquitted the Senate leader of all charges. Saraki’s lawyers argued that the allegation made against their client was based on petitions from complainants who never appeared as witnesses to testify.
The lawyers, led by a former Attorney General of the Federation, Kanu Agabi, further argued that the petitions did not form part of the documents presented in court.
Samuel Madujemu, a CCT official, who testified regarding the bureau’s findings, stated that the evidences he presented in the tribunal were based on information provided by the bureau’s investigation team.

Another member of the tribunal’s bench, William Atedze, said it was unlawful to depend on the word “team”, for the presentation of evidence. He added that the law does not recognize “team” as a source of evidence.
“Evidence alluded to in any court of law should only be given by a witness who saw, heard or took part in the transaction, upon which he is testifying to.
“The evidence is incurably defective. The prosecution has failed to link the defendant with the alleged offence,” Atedze said.
