A fake doctor that specialises in massaging patients penises to discharge sperm and sucked it has been arrested by the police in Minna, Niger state.

The 50-year-old quack, identified as Usman Umaru, who worked at the Out Patient Department of the Minna General Hospital, Niger state, was allegedly indulging in the act.

National Daily learnt that the fake doctor has been doing it for the past two years before he was caught and arrested after he tried it on a 40-year-old patient who could not release after several minutes of massaging.

It was further learnt the inability of the 40-year-old man identified as Sani Baitachi to release got Umaru angry, and he slapped leading the patient.

As a result, an argument arose between the two men which attracted the attention of the hospital’s management and Umaru was apprehended.

The Deputy Chief Medical Director of the Minna General Hospital, Dr. Hussaini Yabagi who confirmed the development said, “Management will follow the case to its logical conclusion so that it will serve as deterrent to others.”

It was gathered that the fake doctor has sucked no fewer than 10 patients’ sperm so far.

On how he does it, National Daily learnt that Umaru has penchant for luring the patients away from the real medical doctor in charge of their cases, and would take them into one of the hospital wards and massage their penises.

As soon as they discharge on his palm, he would lick the sperm and then discharge them without administering further treatment.
