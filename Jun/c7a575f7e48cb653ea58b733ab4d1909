As the proliferation of universities in the country continues, the Nigerian Army is set to commence academic activities in its own university in Borno State.

The University located in Biu, Borno, will take off next September, as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai disclosed while receiving the Certificate of Occupancy and the master plan for the university site from Gov. Kashim Shettima in Maiduguri on Monday.

He said that the Army had already reached out to the National Universities Commission (NUC) to secure approval for the university.

National Daily learnt that the Army engineers had begun construction work at the site with a view to making the take off possible in September.

He said that funding for the university project was captured in the 2017 budget and commended the Federal Government for its commitment to the take off of the institution.

It was gathered that the university was being designed as a specialized institution that would serve as solutions centre especially to specific challenges facing the Army and North East.
Gov. Shettima in his response assured that the state government would provide necessary support towards the take off of the institution.




He expressed confidence that when fully functional, it would serve as a reference point for other universities in Africa.
