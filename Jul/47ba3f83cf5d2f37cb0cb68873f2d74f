Following many hours of downpour in Niger, flood displaced many homes and caused deaths in Suleja on Sunday.

Eight members of a household were said to have died in the flood which affected also Tafa local government areas of Niger.

The head of the household survived but his two wives and six children were not lucky.

Many families were affected, and household properties were seen  floating on the water, as people scooped water out of their houses.

The Division ‘A’ Police station in Suleja could not confirm the casualty figure but said his men had visited the flood scenes.

“The flood affected many people who built their houses along the river bank; many houses have been destroyed with unconfirmed number of deaths recorded,” Mohammed Mohammed, the District Police Officer in-charge, said.

“Police are providing security around the scene so that hoodlums will not cart away victims’ property especially those lying outside,” he said.

The National Emergency Management Agency was not also able to give details.

Meanwhile, Abdulkareem Samanja, the Village Head of Hayin Nasarawa-Iku in the nearby Tafa Local Government Area decried the loss of property.

He said he was still awaiting report from ward heads on the incident.
