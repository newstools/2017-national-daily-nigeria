Current figures show that Chelsea are one of the best at making solid benefits from doing away with their ‘wastes’.

Although, they are all basically unwanted players when they left. But sooner than they left, a few of them became valuable and desired asset. Players like Kevin De Bruyne is one of such hot cakes.

And we can’t leave Romelu Lukaku who the club maybe dishing out a mouth watering sum of figure between £65-75m for it’s services. Pogba has shown us how costly our ‘ex-lovers’ can become, when we have want them back.

Chelsea have been earning a fortune from selling substitutes and reserves to bankroll their spending. While, many clubs like Monaco are selling their best legs for huge funds. Chelsea is doing the reverse and they are doing it in style.

On Friday, the Blues flogged Nathan Ake to Bournemouth for an eye-watering £20million after he failed to crack the first team. Owner of the club, Roman Abramovich is top of the investor list having ploughed more than £2 billion into Chelsea.

Abramovich has also made a fortune from selling flops. And his sale means Chelsea have raked in a staggering 411.8m in just three years from selling unwanted players.
