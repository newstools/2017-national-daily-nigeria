Yoruba actor and filmmaker, Aremu Afolayan has cried out in a new video that it shall not be well with Nigeria’s former Minister of petroleum, Diezani Alison-Madueke for stealing Nigeria’s money.

He accused her of being the reason why some Nigerians flee the country in search of greener pastures. He shared his video and wrote, “Haaa. Aiye Deziani koni daaah…. aiye Iya toh bi Deziani ko de tuni daaah! 90 billion dollars recovered from her converted to naira is 27 Trillion nairaaa…. haaaaaa. Melo ni waaa ni Nigeria… 170million. A shey waa ya werey bayiii. We can not fight,we can only rant on social media, shame on nigerians”

And in a typical social media campaign style, he had series of hashtags accompany the post, #LONGLIVESCAREDNIGERIAN#cnnnews #cnn #setlife #actorslife #actorsworld.
