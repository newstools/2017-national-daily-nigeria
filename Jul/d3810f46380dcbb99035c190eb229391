A masquerade identified as okorosha, pursued a school pupil to death in Imo State, Nigeria. National Daily gathered that a 14-year-old pupil was crushed to death on Monday by a fast-moving vehicle while being pursued by a masquerade, aka okorosha, at Ogbaku, Imo State.
An eye witness was said to have disclosed the boy, who was on his way to school at about 9.00am, took to his heels on sighting the masquerade, while the masquerade took advantage of his fright to chase him till he ran into the vehicle which was on high speed along Onitsha-Owerri Road.

After the incident, the masquerade was said to have mixed with other masqueraders, leaving the boy in a pool of blood. Another witness, Mr. Linus Iwuji, blamed the community leaders for allowing the masquerades to roam freely on busy roads rather than restricting them to the village square.
“I blame the community leaders for allowing the masquerades to walk about chasing people. They and their guides even rob and rape women at late hours,” Iwuji said. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Andrew Enwerem, confirmed the incident. He added that the Police were investigating the incident.
