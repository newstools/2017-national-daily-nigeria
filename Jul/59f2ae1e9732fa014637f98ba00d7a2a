A court located in Manchester City, England has hindered the move of Nigerian striker, Kelechi Iheanacho to Leicester City.

The court ruled against his wish in the battle over his image right. US-based First Eleven are in court with Iheanacho’s preferred management team, Stellar Group over his image right.

The striker had approached the court to validate his decision to terminate his contract with First Eleven.

The 20-year-old Nigerian forward handed his image right to Stellar Group in July 2015 when he clocked 18, although First Eleven claims to have been managing his image rights since 2013.

The tribunal in Manchester rejected Iheanacho’s plea to have his contract terminated with First Eleven in favour of a switch to Stellar group.
The court confirmed First Eleven as the real owners of Iheanacho’s image rights.

The ruling has put a halt to Iheanacho’s proposed 29 million pounds move to Leicester City from Manchester City, which was brokered by Stellar group.
