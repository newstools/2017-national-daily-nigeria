The various security operatives in Anambra State have issued a stern warning against plot to stage mass protest in the state in the build up to the November Governorship election.
The heads of security agencies in Anambra State in a joint statement  signed by the Anambra State Commissioner of Police,  Garba Baba Umar, remarked: ‘Our attention has been drawn that some misguided elements have perfected plans to disrupt the relative peace through streets protests and to declare that the Anambra State Governorship Election Scheduled for November, 2017 will not hold.”
The head of security agencies in the state contended that, “This is to achieve their selfish political aggrandizement, thereby, threatening democratic processes, causing serious security threats in Anambra State, in particular, and the Country at large;” admonishing that, ‘This is unacceptable and would not be tolerated.’
The CP cautioned that “In as much as the Command and sister agencies respect the right of individuals to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, we would, however, not fold our arms and watch disgruntled elements truncate the peace in the State which the Law Enforcement Agencies are working assiduously to maintain.”

They acknowledged: “It is to be noted the Governorship Election has been scheduled for November, 2017 by the body responsible for elections in Nigeria and that is the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC); and is the only competent authority that can make any pronouncement regarding the conduct of elections.
“To this end, the security agencies wish to assure the good people of Anambra State that the Election shall hold as scheduled peacefully and successfully.”
They warned; ‘We will not hesitate to deal decisively with any individual or groups under any guise that will disrupt public peace.”
The CP stated that members of the public are enjoined to disregard such pronouncement and go about their lawful businesses, adding: “the security agencies further assure Ndi Anambra and all other residents in the State of their readiness to protect lives and properties.”
