In addition, the Magistrate Musa, ordered Umaru to pay N25, 000 to the complainant as restitution for the goat that he stole.

National Daily gathered that one Amina Mohammed of Maitumbi in Minna had reported the case at the police station on July 24 claiming that the convict stole his goat.

Auta said that Mohammed reported that Umaru had stolen a goat belonging to her, valued at N25, 000 and slaughtered it in a uncompleted building.

While pleading for leniency, Umaru urged the court to show him mercy even though he was convicted according to Section 157 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
