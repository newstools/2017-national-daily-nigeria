The Lagos State government has warned all residents in the State over the likely aftermath of the continuous heavy rainfall being experienced in most parts of Lagos on lives and properties.
A release today by the State Commissioner for the Environment, Dr. Samuel Adejare, noted that the rainfall is bound to disrupt normal activities as well as an untoward effect on landed properties, roads and environment.
He implore all Lagosians to, as much as possible, stay indoors during rainfall, except it is important to their safety and livelihood.
It also advised residents who live in lowland areas, or those close to water bodies to move upland in the meantime to ensure the safety of their lives and properties.
“You are implored as much as possible to stay indoors unless it is essential to your safety and livelihood.  However we strongly advise those who live in lowland and close to water bodies to move upland”, the statement said.
The statement added that officers from the Ministry have been deployed to coastal areas and sites that are susceptible to flooding as part of efforts to protect the lives and properties of the citizenry.
While pledging the preparedness of the present administration to ensuring the well-being and comfort of all citizens, the statement implored Lagosians to call the free toll lines of 112 or 767 for necessary assistance in case of emergency.
