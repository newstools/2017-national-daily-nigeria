The Kwara Must Change, the group itching to recall Senate President Bukola Saraki has described as an empty boast the statement from one of the senator’s loyalists that if the group gets enough signatures, he as the state APC publicity secretary will resign.
 
Sulyman Buhari, according to the group, is not the only one boasting. Saraki’s legislative aide, Olaital Olalowu, has also threatened violence if KMC make any move to recall his boss.
 
“Let it be clear that the process of recall has been initiated. It is a constitutional process that cannot be stopped by any threat. It will take place as announced and shall succeed,” said Abdul Rasq Hamzat in a statement issued on behalf of the group.
 According to him, if the Senate president is as popular as he thinks, there is nothing to worry about, because nobody can recall him without the people.

“This is simply a test of popularity.”
 
The group then called on the police and the DSS to take seriously the the tjreat coming from Saraki’s overzealous aides.

“The signing of the recall register shall hold as announced on August 1st, 2017 and we urge all electorates in Kwara Central to troop out en-mass to sign the register, so as to effect the recall.”

Saraki’s closest ally on the Senate, Kogi West Sen. Dino Melaye just got an ex-parte order asking INEC to maintain the status quo over his own recall started in June.

INEC initially dismissed the order, saying it will carry on the process. But the it later backed off, following the decision by the Senate to probe the commission’s Chairman Mahmoud Yakubu’s past at TETFUND.
