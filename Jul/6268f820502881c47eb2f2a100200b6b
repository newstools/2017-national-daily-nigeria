A former Vice President, Alhaji  Atiku Abubakar, has expressed fresh concerns over the rising threats of integration across Nigeria. The former vice president lamented that Nigeria’s unity is currently under threat.
The Waziri Adamawa stated this while addressing journalists at the Kano Government House whenhe paid a condolence visit to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, following the death of Nigeria’s former Permanent representative to the United Nations (UN), Alhaji Maitama Sule.
‘Sule would have played a major role in the restoration of the country’s unity if he was still alive,” Abubakar remarked.
 “The unity of our people and the role he (Maitama Sule) could have played in the restoration of that unity has gone with him, now we are in a dilemma,” he siad.

Abubakar advocated: “we should not forget the unity of Nigeria because we don’t have somebody like Dan Massani Kano from the North again. Rather, we should try to find people of similar beliefs like Dan Massanin Kano, to continue his good works.
“It is impossible for me to describe his contributions to the evolvement of modern Nigeria but I know we have lost one of our greatest Nigerians that ever lived.”
Atiku Abubakar stated: “Your Excellency, we have come to condole with you as brothers, we have come to pray for the repose of his soul. We thank you very much for giving us this opportunity and we hope the people of Kano will, by the grace of God, produce another Dan Massani who will fit into his footsteps and offer his contributions to the unity and survival of this country.”
This is coming at a time when various groups across Nigeria are clamouring for a breakup of the country.
