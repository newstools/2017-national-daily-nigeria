A 56-year-old man has been sent to prison by a Kano state Magistrates’ Court for turning his daughter into sex slave.

Ibrahim Mohammed was on Friday remanded after the daughter who is now 14 years old explained how the father has been having sexual intercourse with her since the mother died in 2010.

The accused who lives at Hausawa Quarters in Kano is facing a two-count charge of procuring minor and incest.




Explaining to the court, the prosecutor, Inspector Aluta Mijinyawa, said the man began to sexually assault the girl in 2010 when she was just seven years old.

“The victim was seven year’s then, now a 14-year-old girl.” He further explained that when the girl (at her age) realised the degree of the offence and the sinful nature of his father’s act, she resisted the father’s further sexual engagement.

National Daily gathered that since the girl prevented him from having sex with her, he threatened to harm her.

As a result, the girl was said to have reported the father at Metro Police Station in Kano where police begun investigation leading to the assumed arrest.

The prosecutor further reiterated that the offences contravened sections 275 and 390 of the penal code.

Though he pleaded not guilty to the charges, Chief Magistrate Fatima Adamu ordered him to be remanded in prison custody while the case was adjourned to September 12, for further mention.

Meanwhile, National Daily gathered that a women group in Kano, Hotoro Women Development Association, has accepted to sponsor the education of the girl.

The association’s Project Manager, Dr Zainab Nagee, said they have asked the court to allow the girl be assigned to her grandmother, “to enable her resume normal life and go back to school, which we promise to sponsor.’’
