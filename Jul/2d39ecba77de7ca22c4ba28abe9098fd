The disclosure by the Senate President comes after the Nigerian senate had earlier turned the Customs boss out twice for not wearing his uniform.
Recall that Hameed Ali who has never been seen in his uniform since he assumed office as the Customs boss had stated in an interview months ago that he was appointed into office to tackle Customs problems and not to wear uniform.
The Senate President while speaking in the presence of Ali stated that the Customs boss is allowed to wear whatever he deems fit as long as he ends the problem smuggling.
