United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc faulted its inclusion by the Federal High Court in Lagos, in the list of seven banks keeping a total of $793,200,000 in contravention of the Federal Government’s Treasury Single Account (TSA) policy.
The bank in a statement signed by its Group Head, Marketing & Corporate Communications, Bola Atta, said the bank had remitted the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)/ Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) cash to the TSA account since August last year.
UBA denied currently keeping such fund, adding that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had cleared it of any wrongdoing after it remitted the fund.
