A mother, named Rhoda Joshua, has requested a Grade 1 Area Court, Karu, Abuja, to order John Okechukwu of Nasarawa to pay her N800,000  for allegedly impregnating her 14-year-old daughter.
Ms. Joshua told the court on Wednesday that her daughter, who was a Secondary School 1 student in Nasarawa State, had been in sexual relationship with Mr. Okechukwu since 2016.
 “My Lord, my daughter has been seeing this guy since last year when she was 13 and as a mother I noticed she had started having sex with him.
 “I warned her and even beat her to stop it but instead of bringing home a result of flying colours she brought this pregnancy of nine months ago.

 “I kept cautioning my daughter against the relationship and advised her to face her studies because I am a widow but she told me the guy said he wanted to marry her.
 “He impregnated her while she was still in school, so, she had to drop out and since she took in till now that she will give birth, he has never given her even one naira for her or the coming baby.
“I have been the one taking care of her, the pregnancy and her younger one and I have no support from anywhere.
 “So, I am pleading with this court to order him to pay me the sum of N800,000 in damages for allowing her to drop out of school because of the pregnancy and for not taking any responsibility since my daughter became pregnant and for refusing to marry he
