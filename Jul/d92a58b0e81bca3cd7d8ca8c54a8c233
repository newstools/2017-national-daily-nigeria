The Federal Government has approved equal salaries for civil servants with Higher National Diploma (HND) and Degree certificates, thereby bringing to an end the age-long dichotomy between university and HND degree holders in all the para-military services.
This was made known in a statement issued by Abubakar Magaji, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Interior.
Magaji said the decision was reached at a board meeting of the ministry, chaired by Abdulrahman  Dambazau, the Interior Minister.

The recent development affects personnel of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the Nigeria Fire Service, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) and the Nigerian Prisons Board.
“The board directed that all officers with HND should be upgraded to COMPASS 08, which is the salary grade level for holders of degree certificates at entry point,” the statement read.
“While the nomenclature for the HND holders will start with the rank of Senior Inspector, the degree holders are with the rank of Assistant Superintendent II.”
