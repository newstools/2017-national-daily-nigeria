The Police had suspected that it was a con game because the mon­ey requested for ransom was too insignificant. The Police, then, embarked on an intensive search which yielded in the arrest of the suspect, Suleiman, along Kadu­na Road, who thereafter, admitted to the crime.
“The police laid a siege on where the suspect had asked them to bring the money through the mother of the suspect’s phone.
