President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his gratitude to his Guinean counterpart Alpha Conde for the nationwide prayers held last week by Guineans for his recovery and good health, and for his nomination as the chair of the AU 2018 theme in anti-corruption.

Buhari had earlier made a phone call to Conde before writing the letter dated July 24.
Conde is the current Chairman of the Assemblies of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, stated:

“I thank you for your kind and thoughtful action in organizing nationwide prayers for my good health. It is a gesture that I will forever cherish and treasure,” Buhari said in the letter.

“Your Excellency will be pleased to hear that I am making good progress, and as soon as doctors advise, I shall return to my duties and continue serving the Nigerian people who elected me and are daily praying for my recovery.”

A statement by Femi Adesina on Tuesday stated that Buhari had in an earlier letter, accepted his nomination as leader of the “2018 AU Theme on the Fight Against Corruption”, which came from African leaders at the 29th Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the AU in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 4.

“While thanking you for the kind words and for the nomination,” the president wrote to Mr. Conde, “I wish to express my readiness to accept this new important role and to reiterate my commitment to contribute towards our collective efforts to strengthen good governance and development on the continent. I, therefore, look forward to working closely with you in the realization of this objective.”
