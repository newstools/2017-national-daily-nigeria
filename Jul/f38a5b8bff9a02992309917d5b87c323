American model and stripper, Blac Chyna who recently returned to the stripping business has acquired for herself a luxury ride.
The purchase comes some weeks after her messy break up with her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian.
Recall that Rob Kardashian had taken to his social media page on Instagram to expose his baby mama and mother of two alleging that she’s cheating and doesn’t take care of their daughter, Dream.

Blac Chyna who lawyered up after the social media attack was reported to have returned all the gift she got from Rob Kardashian while they were together and moved on to other men.
In a latest move, the model and stripper splashed a whopping $272,000 on a Ferrari and couldn’t wait to show it off.
