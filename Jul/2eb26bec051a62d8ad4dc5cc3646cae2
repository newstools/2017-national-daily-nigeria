The Lagos zonal Chairman of the Petroleum Tankers Drivers (PTD) an affiliate body of the NUPENG, Comrade Rasaq Akanbi has debunked the news making the rounds,linking the body with the fracas that led to the burning down of two banks on creek road Apapa.
Speaking at a press conference held at the PTD office in Apapa,Comrade Akanbi put the records straight,that the incident that occured hasnothing to do with PTD,contrary to the misinformation in the various reports.
“The true side of the story according to our investigation was that the matter started with a police officer and a container driver not tanker driver .
“We have no hands in the matter,we are not the original driver that was shot dead,the driver that was shot dead was a member of the Articulated vehicles Association,we are the PTD tanker driver,a branch of NUPENG,not container drivers.
“We are not involved at all in the matter that happened yesterday,it was to our amazement that attribute that incident to our body,that is why we call this conference to set the records straight.
“When we learnt about the matter,we stop our own loading just for safety of lives and property and when we later observed the situation was conducive for operation we will continue,our PTD tankers deal with products, the articulated vehicles carry containers.
