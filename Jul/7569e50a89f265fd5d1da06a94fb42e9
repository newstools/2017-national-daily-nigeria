Frustrated by insistent bomb blasts that have killed scores and injured many others, a mob on Monday attacked officials of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA).









SEMA officials were dispatched to rescue the injured and evacuate the dead at the scene of a suicide bomb attack in Maiduguri on Monday when the irate youths attacked them.
National Daily gathered that the suicide attack carried out by a lady killed  eight people in the mosque which occurred at Londonciki-Simari area of Maiduguri.


It was learnt that the youths were angered following recent attacks by Boko Haram insurgents in Maiduguri.

Youths that attacked SEMA Emergency Rapid Response team were said to be chanting slogans saying, “leave, we do not need your assistance.”

National Daily gathered that the youths who were ready to kill, were armed with club and sticks with which they smashed one of SEMA vehicles and prevented the team from carrying out its mission.

As a result of the attack, it took the intervention of members of the Civilian Joint Task Force  (CJTF) to rescue the SEMA officials from the scene.

It was learnt that the residents of the area had tried to arrest a suicide bomber whom they had suspected to a suicide bomber but immediately zoomed into the mosque and detonated the explosive strapped on her body.

A witness, Malam Muhammad Grema, who lost some of his friends in the attack, disclosed that the incident occurred about 5:00 AM.

However, luck ran out of two female suicide bombers, as they were killed at Mammanti area on the outskirts of Maiduguri by soldiers who were guarding the trenches.
