As President spends 66 days on medical vacation in UK

By GRACE TOYIN BELLO
The wife of President, Muhammadu Buhari , Aishat Buhari has exposed the figure  behind the fake  photographs of her husband in London which was displayed on the internet at the weekend.
She said that a Nigerian UK-based socialite and blogger named Aisha Alubankudi circulated the photographs.
Mrs. Buhari admitting that though the photographs were authentic and belonged to the blogger, they were, however, not recent images.

Her spokesman Sulaiman Haruna, said: “The picture did not emanate from us. They belonged to her (Alubankudi) and she has responded (to appropriate authorities).”
It will be recalled that Mrs. Buhari had jetted out to London last week to visit her ailing husband.  Ironically, since Alubankudi released the pictures, unsuspecting Nigerians were misled into thinking that President Buhari was relatively hale and hearty.
Buhari has spent 65 days in London on a second medical vacation this year.
