Trading at the investors’ window saw the Naira closing at N369.50, while it also closed at N305.75 at the interbank market.
Traders at the market attributed the further appreciation of the Naira to the outcome of the MPC meeting of the CBN.
Meanwhile, Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, President, Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), said that the mop up of liquidity by the CBN was already impacting the exchange rate positively.
Gwadabe said that the commitments of the apex bank in driving its liquidity mop up in the economy had sent panic to the camps of currency speculators.
According to him, critical stakeholders in the financial market are, by the feat of the apex bank, witnessing a convergence in the prevailing rates between the parallel market and the BDCs.
