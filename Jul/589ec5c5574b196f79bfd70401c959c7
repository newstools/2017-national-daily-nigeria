World luxury car maker Audi has launched a recall for up to 850,000 diesel-fuelled cars to update vehicle software controlling emissions in a bid to avoid potential driving bans, it said on Friday.
The service is also being offered to Porsche- und Volkswagen- branded cars using the same six- and eight-cylinder engines, Audi said.
The German government and car industry have agreed on a diesel rescue plan to be presented early August.
