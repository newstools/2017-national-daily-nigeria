Governor Akinwunmi Ambode Lagos State was displeased with the guiles of the Baale of Shangisha who plotted to deceive the State Government that he was being kidnapped, National Daily reports. Thus, the governor ordered the immediate suspension of the Baale.
Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Teslim Folami, in a memo to the Sole Administrator of Ikosi-Isheri LCDA on Sunday, highlighted that Governor Ambode has directed Ogundare to, henceforth, desist from parading himself as the Baale of Shangisha or discharge any duties attached to chieftaincy matters in the state.
Folami, in the statement, declared:
“This is to inform the public that His Excellency, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, has authorized the deposition and prosecution by the Police of Chief Yusuf Mutiu Ogundare, Baale of Shangisha, with immediate effect.

“This is in accordance with Section 38, Subsection 1 of the Obas and Chiefs Laws of Lagos State which stipulates inter alia: ‘The governor may suspend or depose any Oba or Chief whether appointed before or after commencement of this law, if he is satisfied that such suspension or deposition is required according to customary law or is necessary in the interest of peace or good government’.
“Furthermore, he (Ogundare) is to stop parading himself, purports to exercise or discharge any of the duties attached to Chieftaincy Matters with immediate effect.”
Folami said the deposition follows the formal confession of the Baale to security services that he staged his own kidnap to blackmail the state government. The state’s Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni, while parading the suspects at the Lagos House, Ikeja, had narrated how they conspired to perfect the fake kidnap, all in a bid to implicate the Oba of Magodo, as well as rubbish the state government and security agencies.
Owoseni  after the incidence, some men of the Rapid Response Squad, RRS, on patrol in Alausa area at about 10p.m., apprehended Ogundare after he was dropped by a car which sped off immediately six days ago.
