A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani Kayode, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to resign and go home to rest.
He was of the view that the President or Presidency is not meant to be a tourist attraction, a museum of old fossils or a mausoleum of decaying bodies.

In a series of tweet, Fani Kayode expressed dismay over the influx of Nigerian leaders rushing to the UK at intervals to visit the ailing President. He also expressed concern about “the endless reports that the president will soon return to resume duty by the curious dignitaries in a distant foreign land.’
“It is an act of cruelty to expect this poor man to lead a nation of 180 million. Let him resign, go home and rest,” he declared.
