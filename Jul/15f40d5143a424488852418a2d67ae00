Deji Adeleke, billionaire father of wave-making singer, David Adeleke (Davido) has gone mad, says Osun Governor Rauf Aregbesola. 
Aregbesola made the remark during the campaign rally for the APC’s Senatorial candidate, Mudashiru Hussain, over alleged claimed by the wealthy businessman that the Governor owed him some money.
Speaking at the rally, Aregbesola said Deji’ Adeleke’s sanity might have been affected by his brother’s, Senator Isiaka Adeleke’s death.
“Deji Adeleke is a business man, he is not a politician but it is like his brother’s death has run him mad.” (O dabi pe iku egbon e ti dalori ru). It is a lie that I borrowed money from Deji”, Aregbesola said.
“It is to the glory of God that they got the Certificate of Occupancy of their university from our government. Why didn’t those who are their new friends give them C of O of that university? If Deji Adeleke has so much money, why is he begging me to waive the payable tax of his university? Why can’t he just pay?

“I am bold enough to say this over and over again, because I have never sought assistance from any member of the Adeleke family even during the lifetime of Senator Isiaka Adeleke, nothing as such occurred.
“Though my relationship with the late Adeleke was cordial and beyond politics because we have known each other even before Osun politics because our residences are adjacent to each other in Lagos State.”
Deji Adeleke’s brother, Ademola Adeleke is the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, for the Osun-West Senatorial election holding Saturday. He was formerly with the All Progressives Congress, APC, but quit the party when it became clear he wouldn’t get its ticket to run for the election.
