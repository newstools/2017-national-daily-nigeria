The Baale of Orisumbare Kingdom in Alimosho LGA, High Chief Akeeb Rauf, also said the community was a peaceful one.
He said, “I have confidence in my people. But I believe the police are coming. It’s a peaceful community.”
The Baale, however, reprimanded some youths, taking advantage of restricted vehicular movement, to play soccer on the road. He warned that he would not intervene if they were arrested by policemen.
Party agents at units 0020, 049, 074 and 075 where there were also no security agents said they were not worried because they considered the election a neighbourhood affair, where everyone is known to everybody.
