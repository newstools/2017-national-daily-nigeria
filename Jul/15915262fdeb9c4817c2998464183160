In continuation of its plan to meet international standard in aviation as require by the International Civil Aviation Standard and Recommended Practices (ICAO SARPS), the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) said it has finished a 4- week on-the-job Training (OJT) for 48 Aeronautical Information Services (AIS).




 
The 48 who are products of the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria, took part in the training which took place in Lagos and Kano centres.
 
The Managing Director of NAMA, Captain Fola Akinkuotu who made this known stated that the exercise was part of the critical requirements for the cadets to attain certification by NCAT as full AIS Officers.
 
According to him, by exercise, the cadets, who commenced their nine-month Basic Aeronautical Information Management Officers Course (BAIMO) in October 2016 have been exposed to fundamentals in Maps and Charts, Air Traffic Services (ATS), Meteorology, Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/ Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM), Aerodrome Ground Aids (AGA), Aircraft Operating Characteristics (AOC) among other courses and are due to graduate in August 2017.
 
A workshop on e-Flight Plan and e-NOTAM (Notice To Air men) was also held at the agency’s headquarters in Lagos at the end of the training exercise, designed to help the cadets appreciate the practical aspects of electronic dissemination of aeronautical information to airspace users.
 
He commended the cadets for their “excellent performance,” during the OJT, saying that the result of the training showed that staff of the agency appreciate efforts of management towards building capacity of workers.

Akinkuotu maintained that NAMA would continue to give priority to training and retraining of staff as this would enable them to effectively man the sophisticated Air Traffic Management infrastructure being deployed by the agency.
 
In the same vein, the General Manager of Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) department, Alhaji Kabir in Gusau noted that the OJT exercise was meant to prepare cadets to appreciate the theoretical aspects of their training through practical interface with equipment and colleagues at work stressing that “our choice of training centres like Lagos was deliberate because this is where NOTAMs are promulgated.”
