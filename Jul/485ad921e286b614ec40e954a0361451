A motorcycle operator, Okada rider, was a victim of the heavy rainfall in Ekiti State last Monday. The Okada rider was swept away by flood and later found dead in a canal.
National Daily gathered that there was a terrible flood along Adebayo Iworoko Road, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, resulting from the heavy rainfall which started about 6.00pm till about 8.00pm on Monday.
The motorbike operator was said to have ignored warning and advice by people in the vicinity not to ride through the heavy flood. Thus, in display of driving skill, he lost his life.

National Daily further gathered that the victim had entered the high current flood attempting to cross to the other side of the road but was sent back by people within the vicinity who warned him that the water was too much and he could be swept away. Few minutes later, he came back with full force this time and refused to listen to anyone who tried to stop him while other persons were hailing him, drove violently into the rushing flood.
Unfortunately, when he got to the small bridge, the flood swept him and his bike into the canal and nobody was able to save him. His lifeless body was later found behind Pathfinders Hotel, Iworoko Road, Ado-Ekiti.
