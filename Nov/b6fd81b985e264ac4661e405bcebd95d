As polling progress in Abanbra’s Saturday guber election, reports have indicated large turnouts of voters all over the state in spite of threat by the separatist group IPOB.

Some youths suspected to be members of the group are bumming around though they constitute no threat since they are not armed or aggressive.

The voting too has been largely peaceful.
