Two women identified as Doosul Nambo and Ladi Mhbahme have been rescued while one was killed as herdsmen attempted to rape them in their farms in Benue State.

Benue Police Command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Moses Yamu said the incident happened in Guma Local Government area of the state.

He disclosed on Tuesday in Makurdi that the herdsmen also killed one Apesuu Uhula, who came to the rescue of the women.

The arrested suspected herdsmen are Ibrahim Muhammadu, Abubakar Ahmadu, Ibrahim Fulani and Adamu Bature. Their cows were said to have been arrested too and were in police custody.

The suspects were arrested following a security tipoff when allegedly attempting to rape the victims at Isho Village in Guma local government.

Yamu explained that after the reports got to the Police, they immediately moved to the scene and nabbed some herdsmen that were trying to convey their cow in a canoe while attempting to flee when they sighted the police.

“They were eventually rounded up and held in our custody for further investigation.”

It was gathered that since Benue state government signed into law and full implementation of the Anti-Open Grazing law on November 1, this is the first time police would arrest herdsmen in the state.
