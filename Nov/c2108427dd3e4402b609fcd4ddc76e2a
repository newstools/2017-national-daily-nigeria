Along in the campaign to raise awareness of domextic campaign against men is another civil society organisation called CEE-Hope.

The late Lawrence Idoko was knifed to death by his wife Folashade (now in custody) over a text message of the other woman she saw in Lawrence’s phone.

Idoko had been facing such abuse and violent threat by his wife before he was finally killed in their house in Ayetoro, Lagos.

According to neighbours, Folashade had been bitching everybody in the neighbourhood, and was known for her violent tantrums.

Joe Odumakin of Women Arise noted that marital violence against men is rising and must be stopped before it further deteriorates.

“For men experiencing domestic violence, silence is no longer golden. Speak up before it is too late. Violence against men in matrimonial setups is on the increase and we must end this menace,” she said.

Her counterpart called on the judiciary to mete out justice according to the constitution of the country as this would help in further curbing domestic violence.

“We believe that injustice to one is injustice to all. We believe that just like women, men can also be victims of domestic violence. We stand for #JusticeForLawrence and we have no doubt that justice will be served in this case,” said Betty Abah of CEE-Hope

“We believe that it will serve as a deterrent to persons who perpetuate gender-based violence, be they men or women.”

The case is being heard at the Magistrate Court, Ebute-Metta.

The December 4 adjournment will allow for legal advice from the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution (DPP).
