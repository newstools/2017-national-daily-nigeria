Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has joined in the Romelu Lukaku bashing with a strongly worded piece of criticism for him over his behaviour against Brighton.

The Belgium international got away with what looked a clearly deliberate kick on Gaetan Bong, with the referee missing it at the time and no retrospective punishment given.

Lukaku is not having the best of times at Old Trafford at the moment, scoring just one goal in his last eleven games for the club despite getting off to a flying start prior to that.

While Jose Mourinho has defended his summer signing against the critics, Scholes has weighed in on the negative feeling towards the player by slamming him over the incident with Bong.

‘Lukaku knows he has done well there and knows he’s lucky not to get any action against him,’ BT Sport pundit Scholes is quoted in the Daily Mirror.

‘It’s reckless and stupid and probably deserves to be sent off.’

Scholes is not one to mince his words and the pressure will certainly be on Lukaku to improve on his recent displays if he is to win over both the club’s fans and vocal group of former players who set extremely high standards at Manchester United.
