Veteran Nollywood actress, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde has taken to social media to write a note to the newly weds, Banky W and Adesua.

The screen diva who did turn up for Banky W and Adesua Etomi’s wedding last weekend, advised them on how to make their marriage last.

She wrote:

“Dear Banky and Adesua, After capetown, everyone leaves…it’s just you two. My darlings if possible, stay off social media a bit. Communicate continuously. Preserve your friendship not just your love. Even as you two have now become one, don’t forget to respect your individuality. We love you and are rooting for your special Love.”
