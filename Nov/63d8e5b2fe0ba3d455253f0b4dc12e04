Ademola Odusote, a Lagos-based lawyer, has filed a suit against Ibrahim Idris, inspector-general of police (IGP), at a federal high court, Abuja.

Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), is a co-defendant in the suit, which was filed on Wednesday.

Odusote said the failure of the police to respect court orders would make litigants resort to ” self-help and stop using my services”.

He said Malami being the chief law officer of the country should advise President Muhammadu Buhari to remove the IGP from office.

“Idris should forthwith obey and enforce all subsisting court judgements won against the police,” the suit read.

“IGP’s continuous breach of the provisions of section 287(3) of the 1999 constitution (as amended), thereby posing immense threat to the sustenance of our democracy.

“IGP has continuously and flagrantly disobeyed and refused to enforce court judgements, particularly, the judgement delivered on Thursday, 9th November, 2017 by honourable justice Gabriel Kolawole in suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/176/2017, between The Incorporated Trustees of Peace Corps of Nigeria and 49 others vs. Nigeria Police Force & 5 others.

“That I am aggrieved as a legal practitioner and have instituted this suit because if court judgements are perpetually treated with disdain my source of livelihood will be threatened, being that litigants will resort to self-help and stop using my services.”

He said IGP’s actions were “tantamount to circumventing the law as well as undermining due administration of justice, independence, authority and powers of the judiciary”.
