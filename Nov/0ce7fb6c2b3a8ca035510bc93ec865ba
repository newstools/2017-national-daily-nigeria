A 56-year-Fulani herdsman, frustrated, has plunged into the River Benue in the Logo Local Government Area of Benue , according to the Miyietti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Benue chapter.

The group’s National Coordinator Garus Gololo said Mohammed Abdulkadire committed suicide after he lost 200 of his cows to hunger and lack of water.

The Benue State Government on November 1 started  enforcing its anti-open grazing law, leading to some herdsmen relocating to other states.

Since the law kicked in, Gololo said Fulani herdsmen have lost about 600 cows due to poor feeding and inaccessibility to water.

Abdulkadire, who had 22 children, cried and jumped into the river out of frustration when he discovered that 200 out of his 500 cows had died where they were camped, looking for a means to relocate from Benue State.

“He was to relocate to the Awe LGA of Nasarawa State but information got to us that the area was occupied and no herdsman or herdsmen should cross over to the area again,’ said Gololo.

“We are calling on the Federal Government to intervene to quickly make provision for herdsmen in Benue State before they lose everything they have.”

Following incessant clashes between herdsmen and farmers across the nation, state government decided to legislate against open grazing which has been identified as the root ause of the violence.

Ekiti was the first to make the law.
