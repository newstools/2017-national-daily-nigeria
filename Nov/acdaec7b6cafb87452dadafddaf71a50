The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, ASUP, has commenced what it calls  a “total and comprehensive indefinite” strike on Monday because the federal government  failed to fulfil the outstanding agreement made with the union.

According to the union President Usman Dutse,  there was a meeting between the union and ministry of labour on October 16 with an agreement to develop a memorandum of understanding to resolve the issues.

“We were told by the federal ministry of labour that a memorandum of understanding will be given, but we’ve not gotten one till date and that is why our members say there is no seriousness on the side of the government,” he told Premium Times on Sunday.

Dutse said another meeting with the federal government has been scheduled for Wednesday, November 15.

“All academic activities will be suspended during the strike,” he said.

“Our union is constrained to lament that our sector is on the verge of collapse and needs all the emergency attention it urgently deserves.”

Nigeria’s tertiary education has been swamped in crisis since the beginning of the APC government. And the teaching and non-teaching unions involved in industrial actions have been accusing the federal government of making promises it is not ready to fulfil.
