Following their clash before the Federal Executive Council yesterday, Chief of Staff Abba Kyari and Head of Civil Service Winifred Oyo-Ita have been summoned by President Muhammadu Buhari .

The two engaged in an open argument right in the presence of V.P Yemi Osinbajo who was said to be pleading with them to keep their clothes on.

The argument was on the leaked memo published by the Punch which quoted the HOCS warming Buhari on the consequences of re-instating Abdulrasheed Maina, the fugitive pension reform scammer the just go grafted back into the interior ministry mid-October.

Kyari was said to have accused Oyo-Ita of leaking the memo—as she too insisted Kyari did it.

Others witnessing the verbal storm were Sen. President Bukola Saraki, Speaker  Yakubu Dogara, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, John Odigie-Oyegun; service chiefs and ministers.

Saraki, Dogara, Oyegun and the service chiefs were present to witness the inauguration of  the new Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, as well as the launching of the 2018 Armed Forces Remembrance emblem.

Many Nigerians already believe Buhari was in the know when Maina was smuggled back in by AGF Abubakar  Malami and Interior Minister Abdulrahaman Danbazzau.

The president, however, ordered Maina’s disengagement  and arrest following how the government was scandalised by the news of the suspect return to government service.

The PDP said in a press statement that Nigerians no longer believe in the APC government anti-corruption campaign, alleging further that Maina was not only reinstated, but was also paid salary arrears amounting to N22 million.

The Wednesday fight, according to reports, embarrassed Buhari so much he even wondered about their disrespect for his V.P who was on seat while the two throwing allegations.
