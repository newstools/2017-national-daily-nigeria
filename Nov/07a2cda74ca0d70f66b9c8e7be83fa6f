The former Ivory Coast international is still plying his trade at the age of 39, having become the first player-owner in the history of the game when he took over Phoenix Rising FC in 2017.

And Drogba, who lifted the UEFA Champions League trophy with Chelsea in 2012, has announced he will bring down the curtain on a 20-year career in the game.

“I think next year will be my last season. There comes a time when you have to stop,” Drogba told RMC.

“I need time for my other projects. It’s good to play, but at 39, it holds me back a bit.”
