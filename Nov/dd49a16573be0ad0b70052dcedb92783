A group named Eloquent Speech International recently organise a program that helped school kids launch their unique projects and inspired them unto greatness.

The program came under its ‘Raising Young Leaders 2017’ education and training platform and it involved training such as book writing, web designing, swimming, fashion designing, football and journalism. Held on Saturday, November 25 at Grange School in Ikeja, Lagos.

And young children between the ages of four to nine years old were trained on such skills and afterwards they showcased their works to the audience.

“Raising Young Leaders training platform was able to train five of its students previously to be involved in lofty projects like Art work exhibition and Kiddies Dictionary launch, this year we are opening more skills to them that will equip them for the future because most celebrated leaders in history are gifted speakers, we took it on us to catch young people, train them, such that they are better equipped to undertake leadership roles immediately” Mrs Josephine Adeniyi, Co-founder of YPS stated.

The group which also has Young Public Speakers YPS platform aimed at grooming young leaders to attain excellence in public speaking, trained three young kids in producing three books.

Bellow are the photos of the event and the young persons that launched their projects:
