Andrea Christensen’s rise to the top continues after becoming Chelsea’s first club-grown player to start three successive Premier League games since John Terry in 2001.
The centre-back appears to have displaced David Luiz in the centre of Antonio Conte’s three-man defence for good.
Andreas Christensen is the first Chelsea academy graduate to play three consecutive league games since John Terry
And after starring in wins over Manchester United and West Brom – with Chelsea keeping clean sheets in both games – Christensen was given the nod for the weekend draw against Liverpool.
The Dane played 90 minutes in all three matches, and is now the first academy graduate to accomplish the feat since Stamford Bridge legend Terry broke through in the 2000/2001 campaign.
Chelsea fans are sure to be delighted at finally seeing a former youngster nail down a spot in the starting XI.

Christensen spent the last two seasons on loan at German giants Borussia Monchengladbach.

And his impressive performances convinced Antonio Conte to hand him a recall last summer at the expense of Kurt Zouma.
However, Christensen’s new role raises questions over the future of David Luiz.
The Brazilian has made just one appearance in Europe since the heavy 3-0 Champions League group stage defeat to Roma.
And with Cesar Azpilicueta, Gary Cahill and Antonio Rudiger preferred in the wide centre-back positions, Luiz may be forced into a second Chelsea exit much sooner than anticipated.
