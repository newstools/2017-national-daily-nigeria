The hammer of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), has fallen on 72 CBT centres who were found to have compromised during the 2017 examination.

The JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, said as a result, the 2018 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) is not going to be business as usual as all centres will be equipped with electronic devices during examinations.

He spoke at Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), during a parley with operators of Computer-Based Test (CBT) centres.

Oloyede explained that the board discovered that some electronic devices like pen, wristwatches and phones were used to perpetrate examination malpractice during the 2017 UTME.

Oloyede stressed that due to the board’s zero tolerance for irregularities and corrupt practices, it would also install electronic jammers in all CBT centres to frustrate those planning to cheat during examination period.

“We have introduced new measures that would further add to the integrity of the registration process and conduct of the UTME.”

On the commencement of sale of registration forms for the 2018 UTME, the registrar disclosed that the board would meet with stakeholders on November 15 to review the process adding that the sale of forms would begin before the end of the month.

“Before that, we expect students to download the applications from JAMB’s website, which include the syllabus and the brochure to enable them study the registration procedure to minimise errors,” he said.

Oloyode explained that while 72 CBT centres had been disaccredited over various offences, the board has so far, registered 617 operators in addition to existing ones.
