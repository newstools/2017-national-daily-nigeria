Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama has reportedly told Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) that he will only make a return to the national team if he is 100 percent fit.

Since the qualification of the Super Eagles for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, there have been many talks that Nigeria need Vincent Enyeama back to the Super Eagles.

Many are of the opinion that Vincent Enyeama’s experience will be needed in Russia, while many sports pundits believe that Rohr should give another goalie the chance.

According to a NFF source, Enyeama is willing to return, but he has told coach Rohr that he would only make a return to the Super Eagles if he feels fit and good enough to be the first choice for the World Cup.

“Vincent is working hard to regain his fitness and form before giving his final answer to Rohr on his likely recall to the Super Eagles. He wants to merit his recall and not rejoin the team based on emergency. He has resumed training after undergoing surgery and may probably return to action with a new club,” the NFF source said.
