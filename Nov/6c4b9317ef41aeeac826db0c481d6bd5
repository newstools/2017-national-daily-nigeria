Cristiano Ronaldo wants to leave Real Madrid, according to bombshell report from Chiringuito TV in Spain.

The Portugal international has undergone a dip in form in recent months, scoring just one La Liga goal so far this season.

And Ronaldo is now reportedly ready to leave by June 30, having rejected a new contract at the Santiago Bernabeu.

The four-time Ballon d’Or winner’s request to depart was rejected by Real president Florentino Perez, only worsening their relationship.
