Revelations from the All Progressives Congress (APC) controlled federal government are not only raining questions on the widely celebrated integrity of President Muhammadu Buhari but has been ridiculing the Nigerian government.

I ask our President, what has happened to the report on the $43 millionj discovered in an apartment at Osbourne Towers, Ikoyi, Lagos?2. What has happened to the allegation of award of $25 billion contracts without following due process made against Dr. Baru by Dr. Ibe Kachikwu?3. What happened to the DSS indictment for corruption of Magu and the AGF Investigative Panel set up by the President?4. Who is the owner of LEGICO Shopping Plaza, Ahmadu Bello Way, VI, Lagos inside which the EFCC claimed that it found N448.8 million cash?
