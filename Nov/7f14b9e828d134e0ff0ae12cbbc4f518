In a bid to foster better Civil-Military Relations, Nigerian Air Force on Saturday in Lagos engaged in environmental sanitation exercise  deploying officers and men to Mafoluku and Shogunle Communities for a Clean-up.

National Daily reports that the two communities located at Lagos mainland, are known for its congestion with inadequate sanitation and low-quality housing.

Wing Commander Alfred Ogbonda, who represented Air Commodore Sayo Olatunde said, “The military need the civil populace to succeed and this is one of the activities to bring civilians closer to the military.

During the clean up exercise, airmen and women cleared refuse dumps and the blocked drains with used water bottles, nylons and sundry waste.

Wing Commander Ogbonda noted that event like this helps the military to reach out and interact with the local communities.

He said, “At times, we do medical outreach and free medical treatment, which is also a way of interacting with the local communities.

“By interacting with the communities, they can also be of help by giving the military useful information on intelligence gathering on internal security operations,” he said.

He reiterated that the sanitation exercise was part of civic responsibility of everyone, adding that part of its corporate social responsibilities was to interface with the public and the government.

He, however, appealed to residents of Mafoluku and Shogunle to maintain a clean and healthy environment.

Members of both communities expressed joy and satisfaction noting that the Air Force had done well for the intervention.
