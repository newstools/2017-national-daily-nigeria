Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi has confirmed that he will play no part in Tuesday’s friendly in Krasnodar, Russia between Argentina and the Super Eagles.

Messi was in action for Argentina in Saturday’s 1-0 win over 2018 World Cup hosts Russia in Moscow.

He will return to his base in Barcelona, Spain ahead of his club’s Spanish La Liga fixture next weekend against Leganes.
