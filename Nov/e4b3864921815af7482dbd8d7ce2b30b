A 43-year-old, Saburi Yusuf, who was arraigned before an Abeokuta, Magistrates’ Court sitting in Isabo Ogun state allegedly accused of damaging a car and the windscreen, told the court that he preferred going to jail than pay for the damage.

Appearing before Magistrate Idowu Olayinka on one-count charge of malicious damage, pleaded guilty to the offence.

When Magistrate Olayinka asked the defendant if he would be able to pay for damages rather than go to prison, he said he preferred going to jail.

“I rather go to jail instead of paying damages; I have no source of getting any money,” he said.

However, after hearing from both the defendant and the complainant, Olayinka remanded Yusuf in prison and adjourned the case until January 26, 2018 for more facts and sentence.

He said when Yusuf was interrogated after his arrest, he claimed he was sleeping by the roadside after attending a naming ceremony and was drunk, “all of a sudden, I felt someone kicked me and I later discovered that it was the complainant.

“I then went to his house to damage his properties because he even undressed me.”
Shonibare said the offence contravened Section 516 of the criminal code laws of Ogun 2006.
