Fitch Ratings has assigned Nigeria’s $1.5 billion 6.5 per cent Senior Unsecured Notes due November 28, 2027 and $1.5 billion 7.625 per cent Senior Unsecured Notes due November 28, 2047 the final rating of ‘B+’.
The final rating replaces the expected rating of ‘B+ (EXP)’ that Fitch assigned on November 15.
The expected rating is in line with Nigeria’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of ‘B+’ with a negative outlook.
The rating, Fitchsaid, was sensitive to any changes in Nigeria’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR.
