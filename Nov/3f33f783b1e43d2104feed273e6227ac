“The French presence is not the only one, we have other countries that is operating with us and that is why if there is any attack or act if piracy, we are always notified on time.

“If you check closely from your record for the past one year, act of piracy generally in our Lagos area has reduced greatly,” he said.

“I hope the existing cooperation between the two navies will continue to go on and we are very delighted to be received by the FOC.

“It is an operation that began in 1990 to be able to cooperate with African navies. We will be in Nigeria for two days and would after, proceed to Gabon to cooperate with their navies.

“After Gabon, we would have an exercise at the end of November with other navies and the Nigerian Navy will also participate,” he reiterated.
