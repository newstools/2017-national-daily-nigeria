Days after his sack by President Muhammadu Buhari, Ayodele Oke, erstwhile director general  of the National Intelligence Agency, has been invited for questioning by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alongside his wife, Folasade over the $43 million, N23 million and £27,000 recovered from an Ikoyi apartment suspected of belonging to the couple.
 
Their invitation signals the continuation of investigations into the cash haul with operatives of the anti-graft agency’s Lagos zonal office saying they are going ahead to unravel the source and real owner of the cash.

“In furtherance of its investigative activities to unravel the circumstances surrounding the $43.45 million cash recovered by operatives of the EFCC in Lagos sometime in April 2017, we have invited former Director General of the NIA and his wife,” an official of the agency said.
 
The EFCC had in April invited Mrs. Oke but she failed to show up because President Muhammadu Buhari had set up a committee to investigate the matter.
However, following the sack of her husband and the statement by the Presidency that the EFCC was free to continue its investigation, the graft agency sent out letters of invitation to the couple and some officials of the NIA.
 
Others who are expected to report to the EFCC for interrogation include a bureau de change operator, Sulah Petroleum and Gas Limited, and officials of the NIA.
