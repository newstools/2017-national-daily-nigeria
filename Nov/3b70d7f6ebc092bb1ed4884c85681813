PDP chairmanship contestant Bode George has called on former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who dumped the APC on Friday, to return to the PDP he helped established.

George made the call on Sunday in Katsina during his campaign tour in the lead-up to the December 9 national convention when the party chairman will be elected.

“The former vice president is a landlord in the PDP; he was among the G-34 that established it,” George said.

“In the APC, Atiku was just a tenant that could be kicked out any time the landlord wants.

“But in the PDP, nobody can kick Atiku out because he has laboured for the establishment of the party.

“Just because your house is leaking, you cannot abandon it and move to a rented house,” he said.

He urged party members to close rank and do the right thing as the Dec. 9, convention date approaches.

“If we miss to select the right leaders during our convention, then we cannot do anything tangible in 2019 general elections” he said.

George also pleaded with members to avoid in-house fighting that had been dividing members of the party.

The national vice chairman is one of the three contestants from the southwest vying for the party’s chair. Others are for Gov. Gbenga Daniel and Prof. Femi Adeniran.
