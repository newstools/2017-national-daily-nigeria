The Nigeria Customs Service, Sokoto Area Command says in six months, it made 103 seizures including 39 assorted vehicles with the duty paid value of N83.6 million.
 
The command also generated the sum of N829.4 million within the period under review.
Addressing journalists in his office, the Area Comptroller, Nasir Ahmed admitted that porous and un-delineated borders were making anti-smuggling operations very challenging in the area.
 
“The area has 11 approved border stations which were vast and porous in which during dry season many bush paths and farmlands becomes easy access for smugglers. But we will continue to do everything possible to protect the Nigerian economy and to enforce government policies on imports and exports,” Ahmed said.
