Delta State Governor, Senator Dr Ifeanyi Okowa has sent a passionate appeal to the Niger Delta Avengers not to embark on further attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta. 
Okowa made the appeal in a statement issued on Monday in Asaba by his Chief Press Secretary, Charles Aniagwu wherein he noted that Deltans will lose more if the group make good their latest threat to withdraw from further cooperation with the federal government and begin massive attacks on oil facilities.
“We passionately appeal to the Niger Delta Avengers not to resume hostilities, because Deltans will be the greatest losers. We are barely recovering from the effect of previous attacks and it is our honest appeal that they still give peace a chance by allowing for peaceful engagements with the Federal Government and other stakeholders.

“This appeal for peace remains imperative, because without the atmosphere of peace, no meaningful negotiations and development can take place, adding “resumption of hostilities will not be in the interest of our people but a major set back to the plans and aspirations of the state.
“We have continued to appreciate our brothers in the struggle for their continued patience and cooperation while we engage the Federal Government on ways to attend to the various issues being raised by the group.
“As a state, we have made several interventions to make life more meaningful for oil bearing communities especially in the area of road construction in the creeks and without the enabling peace we cannot progress in that direction.” he said.
