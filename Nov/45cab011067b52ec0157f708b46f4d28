There’s a Manchester United news about how an incredible Man City fact that suggests the Red Devils are historically average.

That ‘incredible fact’ is this: ‘Manchester City have more league winning managers in their history than their city rivals who wear red’.

Although, winning 20 league titles (the most in English football history and 16 more than Manchester City’s four) requires an awful lot of statistic massaging to make United look ‘historically average’.

However, the truth is Manchester United had one manager do all the winning, while City had more than one man. Then again, these are just sensational facts for the internet.
