The proposed Federal University of Health Sciences, Otukpo, Benue , might be named after the bill sponsor, Senator David Mark.

Sen. President Bukola Sarakim representated by Chief Whip Sola Adeyeye,  said this at the public hearing on the Federal University of Health Sciences Otukpo (Establisment) Bill 2017 held in Abuja on Monday.

Saraki said there had been calls for naming the yet-to-be-established institution after Mark.

“His focus on this goal is, no doubt, a measure of his commitment to alleviating the huge shortfall in the education and training of critical personnel in the nation’s health sector – and to the people of Benue-South, who the distinguished senator represents,” he said.

“Indeed, I understand there is now a clamour in some quarters, as well as among some of my distinguished colleagues, to rename the university, upon its establishment, after Senator Mark – and the reason is understandable, when we consider the passion with which he has prosecuted the cause of the proposed institution.”

According to him, figures show that only about 20 per cent of those who qualify and apply are admitted to medical schools in this country.

“In July of this year, a newspaper survey indicated that, of nearly 160,000 applicants, only 3000 gain admission into Nigerian tertiary institutions to study medicine and related courses, he added.

The former Senate president has been taking the back seat since Saraki took his job. Mark’s bill will be the most significant thing that got him attention since he became a bench warmer in the House he once controlled.
