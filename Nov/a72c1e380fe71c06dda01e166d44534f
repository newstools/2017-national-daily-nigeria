Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi has named one club he would leave Barcelona for and it is not Premier League club Manchester City.

Recently, there have been many reports that Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is considering bringing Lionel Messi to the Premier League.

Guardiola is said to be hoping to have a reunion with the 30-year-old forward whose contract at Barcelona will expire in the summer.

But Lionel Messi is thinking in another direction as the superstar is reportedly considering a return to boyhood club Newell’s Old Boys in Argentina.

“I still have to play in Newell’s and that is my dream.

“But as I was saying recently, I do not know what will happen in few years from now or how I will go back because I would love it.

“But I hope I can continue at this level to get back to Newell’s because it’s what I dreamed since I was little,” Messi was quoted to have said by the UK Sun.
