With homophobia infiltrating and eluding the values of human rights in Nigeria, the guest contended that due to backgrounds and orientation towards sexual minorities, Nigerians express homophobic traits and attitudes through verbal, physical and emotional aggression.
The duo concluded that the effect of homophobia on sexual minorities is alarming in Nigeria, and advised that the society should educate themselves on the possibility of a country where sexual orientation is seen as part of an ever-evolving human nature rather than where citizens feel the need to marginalize and discriminate against sexual minorities.
