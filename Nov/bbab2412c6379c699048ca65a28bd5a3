To demonstrate that the lives of the poor and needy counts, Pope Francis on Wednesday decided to auction a special Papal-themed Lamborghini Huracán donated to him from company executives at the Vatican.




It was gathered that the Pope decided not to drive the car but to auction it off for charity on his behalf.

The money that would be realised from the sale, it was learnt, would be met towards helping displaced Christians in Iraq, victims of trafficking and prostitution, and Italian charities working with women and children in countries in Africa.

Reacting, Nonso Ogbonna asked on his Facebook wall, “Do Africans really have men of God? What we have here, mostly in my country are bunch of fraudsters con business men in suits, telling you how Jesus and Elijah multiplied loaves of bread n how it will turn sorrows to joy only when you bring money to the alter. I don’t serve a poor God so must be not be poor mentality men in suits,” he stated.
