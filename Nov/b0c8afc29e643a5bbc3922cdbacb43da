Leading building solutions provider, Lafarge Africa Plc, has partnered with Canaancity Consortium, an association of indigenous and foreign companies, on a safety awareness programme for 200 employees of the consortium.
The partnership is aimed at improving the safety standards and practices at the sites of Canaancity which is building over 700 housing units in the first phase of estates it is developing. More estates are planned. Directors and heads of projects of the consortium attended a one-day health and safety training at the Covenant University guesthouse, Otta, Ogun State yesterday.
Speaking about the training initiative, Graeme Bride, Director for Health & Safety at Lafarge Africa Plc said: “We are always pleased to share our experience on safety in the Nigerian construction industry. Our aspiration to do business with zero harm is not limited to our factories and employees. We are also particular about safety on the sites of clients and contractors.”

During the training programme, engineers, technicians and other operational employees were trained on the risks related to their construction work while health workers were trained on how to prepare for and respond to emergencies. There were also sessions on the best onsite safety practices such as deployment of safety signage as well as procedures for reporting and responding to incidents.
