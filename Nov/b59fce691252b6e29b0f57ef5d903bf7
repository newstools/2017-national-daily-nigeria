Chelsea manager Antonio Conte is reportedly on a list of potential candidates to replace Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.

Despite guiding the club to back-to-back Champions League crowns and clinching the La Liga title last season, the former France international is under pressure at the Bernabeu.

As it stands, Los Blancos are eight points adrift of league leaders Barcelona and they qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League beneath Tottenham Hotspur.

According to Diario Gol, if Madrid lose to Barca in El Clasico on December 23, Zidane could be shown the door and a temporary coach will be installed until a permanent one is appointed in the summer.

The report claims that Conte, whose Chelsea future has been in doubt numerous times this season, is a potential candidate for the Spanish outfit.

Germany head coach Joachim Low is also believed to be under consideration.
