Some six residents of Ikorodu were on Tuesday arraigned in an Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly bashing a Divisional Police Officer on his way to work.

The accused are two women– Kehinde Alimot, 40 and Bukola Ahmed, 32—and four men–Ifeanyi Kanu, 22; Owolabi Ibrahim, 39; Aikulola Olamiji, 54, and Jamiu Yussuf, 39.

They  were arraigned before Magistrate A.B. Adelabu-Olagbegi on a three-count bordering on conspiracy, unlawful assault and causing a breach of peace.

But they all pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The magistrate, then, granted them bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum.

Police Prosecutor Sgt. Mary Ajiteru said that the accused committed the offences on Oct. 26 along Agunfoye Road, Igbogbo in Ikorodu at about 12.45 a.m.

According to Ajiteru, the accused, including a nursing mother, battered their victim, one Supol Issah Lawal, a DPO attached to the Igbogbo Police Station.

Ajiteru said the offences contravened Sections 411, 168 (d), 174(b) of the Lagos State Criminal Code Laws, 2015.

The magistrate adjourned the case until Dec. 14 for trial.
