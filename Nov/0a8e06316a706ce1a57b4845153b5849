After about four decades of bestriding Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe resigned as president on Tuesday following a week long siege by the nation’s military.

His number was up after his political allies moved against him.

Mugabe, 93, put up some resistance evem when his ruling party ZANU-PF denounced. But he caved in as parliament began an impeachment process, the only constitutional way to upstage him.

Speaker Jacob Mudenda announced Mugabe’s resignation and suspended the impeachment procedure.

There was so much jubilation in the streets of Harare at news that the independence hero turned autocrat finally bowed out.

Mugabe is the only leader Zimbabwe has known since a guerrilla struggle ended white-minority rule in the former Rhodesia in 1980.

Mugabe ruined the economy of the formerly rich southern African nation.

However, Mugabe, who calls himself the Grand Man of African politics, garners administration from some leaders in Africa.

Mugabe led Zimbabwe’s liberation war and is hailed as one of post-colonial Africa’s founding fathers and a staunch supporter of the drive to free neighbouring South Africa from apartheid in 1994.
