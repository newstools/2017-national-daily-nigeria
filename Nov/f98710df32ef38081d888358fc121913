Nigeria’s power transmission capacity has increased by 600 megawatts after it recently energised the second Asaba-Benin 330kV transmission line.

In a statement issued by the Transmission Company of Nigeria’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah, the company said the newly energised Asaba-Benin transmission line will provide alternative source of energy to the 330kV transmission sub-station in Asaba, Delta State.

It said the line, which was completed and not put to use since October 22, 2016, was finally commissioned into service after its engineers completed the relay setting at the Asaba and Benin end of the transmission line

“The commissioning into service of the new transmission line brings to three, the number of 330kV transmission lines from the Onitsha axis to Benin. These three lines have the capacity to carry 600MW each,” Mbah said.

“And with the new line, the total capability of the 330kV transmission lines on the Benin axis has increased from 1,200MW to 1,800MW.”

She stated that energising the new transmission line would provide alternate route for power flow from Benin to Onitsha, and would assist in ensuring system stability, flexibility and redundancy on the line route.

“This means that the TCN can transmit more power on this route and that fault or tripping of one of the lines would not affect power transmission in the area,” Mbah added.

She added that the TCN  will  keep investing in the expansion of the country’s power grid.

Other transmission lines, transformers and new sub-station projects are going on in many locations nationwide.
