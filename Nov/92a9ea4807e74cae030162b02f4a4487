Osinbajo said the government would be meeting with the World Bank, on a scheme that would involve “a fair amount of subsidy”.
“Listening to questions concerning lower tariffs, we must pay higher tariffs, these sorts of things are inevitable. What we are trying to do is not increase but how we can ensure we clean up the entire value chain.
