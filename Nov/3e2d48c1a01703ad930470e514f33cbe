Toyota Nigeria has explained that it is working on slashed prices of its trendy Corolla and Yaris to win more buyers in its end of the year sale nationwide. The company also announced a five per cent discount on prices of the two vehicles.
Analysts say this is coming with the plan by the Toyota Motor Corporation to produce a hot homologation special in the next Yaris expected to bring a high-performance version of the car to a wider customer base than the current GRMN model and boost the pace of the manufacturer’s World Rally Championship car.
In a statement, Toyota Nigeria noted that “When you buy a Corolla or Yaris, you automatically get five per cent savings off the original price”.
“For the Corolla, expect excitement to grow with every drive in the car; it’s all thanks to an inspiring combination of agile, sporty and responsive performance with superb fuel efficiency to match.”

“The 2017 edition Corolla effortlessly generates the power for driving pleasure, delivering subtly smooth and stable performance.”
Toyota also observed that “Drivers/riders’ first impression of the Corolla is said to be compelling with its Optitron meters  providing excellent visibility; a drive monitor displaying current fuel consumption, average fuel consumption, cruising range, average vehicle speed and driving time.
“The design, touch to the hand, and ease of use of the shift lever were all carefully considered to give an excellent operational feel. (With) the Integrated Steering Wheel Switches, you can change the volume and mode of the audio system without taking your hands off the steering wheel,” Toyota noted.
