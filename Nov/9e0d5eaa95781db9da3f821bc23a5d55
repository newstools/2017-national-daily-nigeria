Men of the Department of State Security were at daggers drawn with operatives of the EFCC at the home of the DSS former DG Ita Ekpeyong  in Abuja Tuesday.

The EFCC operatives arrived at the scene, 46 Mamman Nasir Street,  Asokoro, around 11am with an arrest warrant. The armed DSS officials, some of them wearing masks, would not allow the EFCC men inside.

The DSS officials said they were acting on “orders from above”.

Ita was named among the collaborators in $21,1 billion arm purchase scandal co-ordinated by former NSA Sambo Dasuki in 2015m in the lead up to the general election.

The DSS, however, hasn’t allowed the EFCC to dig into Ita’s role in the scam.

There are political undertones to the lingering face-off between the two that started since 2015. The gladiators largely have been the NSA Babagana Moguno and the DSS boss Lawan Daura who have been locked in a supremacy way.

EFCC Chairman Ibrahim Magu reportedly is a protégé of the NSA.
