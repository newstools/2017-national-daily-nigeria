Manchester United have reportedly told Jose Mourinho that he must trim the size of his Manchester United squad before he is given significant funds to strengthen.

The United boss has spent £285million on new recruits since his arrival at Old Trafford 18 months ago and, according to the BBC, the board “want to control costs before sanctioning more outlay on new signings”.

The latest financial figures released in September showed that the wage bill had risen by 13 .5% to £263.5m and the top brass are keen not to see that spiral any further.

Luke Shaw, who joined United for £27million in 2014, appears most likely to be sold, with the left-back failing to convince Mourinho even when he is injury-free. The former England starlet is yet to even make the bench for a Premier League game this term.

Doubts persist over Marouane Fellaini’s future, too, despite his status as one of Mourinho’s most trusted lieutenants. The Belgium midfielder has yet to agree terms on a new deal as he approaches free agency next summer.

Since Mourinho arrived, United have recouped significant funds only from the sales of Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay, though big earners Wayne Rooney and Bastian Schweinsteiger have also been shipped out.
