President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the reinstatement of the security aides of Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State.

While welcoming the President on arrival Wednesday in Awka for the grand finale of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Rally, the governor had complained about the withdrawal of his security aides.

Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, in statement revealed that before departing Awka, President Buhari directed the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations), Joshak Habila, to ensure the return of the governor’s security personnel.

The Senate also on Wednesday ordered the IGP to immediately reinstate Obiano’s security details.

Obiano’s security details were withdrawn by the Police Inspector-General, Ibrahim Idris, on Tuesday. The IGP said the action was taken to prevent a similar scenario as that which played in an unnamed state where the military caught an ADC to a governor escorting a vehicle loaded with arms on Election Day.

“We do not mean anything bad to Anambra governor on this action; his ADC will be returned to him early Sunday morning after the governorship election on Saturday Nov.18.

“We have equally withdrawn all the policemen attached to political appointees, Local Government Chairmen and others in Anambra till after the election,” he said.

The IGP explanation was widely considered absurd.
