French club, Paris Saint-Germain have set a new record for goals scored in the group stage of the Champions League, after their 7-1 thrashing of Celtic on Wednesday night.

The Ligue 1 outfit has now scored 24 goals so far in Group B, shattering the old record of 21 set by Borussia Dortmund in 2016.

Unai Emery’s men still have one more game to extend their new record.

Moussa Dembele opened scoring within 60 seconds, but Neymar equalized for PSG before giving them the lead. Edinson Cavani struck twice and Kylian Mbappe, Marco Verratti and Dani Alves all netted each.

“I think that the team played a very complete match,” Emery said after the final whistle.

“The only negative was the goal we conceded but the team reacted well to that early setback and we controlled the ball throughout the game.

“We pressed very well and we always wanted to score more. We played some beautiful football, we were very ambitious and we need to continue like this to keep improving.”
