A presidential decree on Wednesday said Ms Isabel dos Santos had been replaced by Mr Carlos Saturnino.
Ms dos Santos was appointed to chair the Sonangol board of directors by her father in June 2016.
She was tasked with the responsibility of restructuring the state company.
President Lourenço took over from dos Santos in August, following an election, marking the end of a 38-year reign.
His sacking of the predecessor’s daughter was seen as a powerful message asserting his authority.
