It was a huge harvest of deaths on Saturday after a fighter jet belonging to the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) attacked a building in Sambisa, where Boko Haram insurgents were said to be having a meeting and killed everybody in attendance.
NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, (DOPRI) Air Commodore Olatokunbo Adesanya, said on Saturday in a statement in Abuja.
Adesanya said: “On 30th October 2017, the NAF conducted an air interdiction mission on a blue-roofed structure in TALALA, a Boko Haram Terrorist (BHT) infested location in Sambisa.
“Intelligence reports from NAF Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms as well as Human Intelligence had revealed that a sizeable number of BHTs were holding a meeting in the blue-roofed building.”
National Daily gathered that based on facts on the ground, a NAF fighter aircraft was scrambled to attack the building.
“Subsequent Battle Damage Assessment revealed that the building and its occupants were neutralised as a result of the air strike.
“It would be recalled that the NAF initiated Operation RUWAN WUTA II, on 23 October 2017, to further decimate the ability of the BHTs to freely operate with a view to giving advantage to our surface forces and thereby frustrate the efforts of the Terrorists to recapture any Nigerian territory,” Air Cdre Adesanya reiterated.
