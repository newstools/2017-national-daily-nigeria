Real Madrid sponsors Audi have gifted the Los Blancos stars with new Audi exotic cars after Cristiano Ronaldo broke his own record for goals in the Champions League.

The automobile giants have a tradition of gifting cars to staff and players of Real Madrid annually and this time around it was Cristiano Ronaldo’s record breaking goals in the 6-0 thrashing of APOEL that motivated the car gifts.

Ronaldo, 32, received the most powerful motor that Audi offered to the players.


CR7 opted for the RS7 model, which packs over 600bhp and costs your regular punter just over £150,000.

Real Madrid gaffer, Zinedine Zidane, went for the similarly powerful RS6 model.

Sergio Ramos and Gareth Bale both got decent rides from Audi

Sergio Ramos went for the most expensive model. The R8 Spyder takes you above the £200,000 mark.

Two of Real’s other stars, Gareth Bale and Isco, went for something a little more sensible.

]The spacious Q7 Sport – with plenty of room for the Welshman’s golf clubs – has just 272bhp and is just over £70,000.


The Real Madrid players also participated in racing simulation games

Real Madrid duo of ani Ceballos and Mateo Kovacic were the least fortunate as they got the cheapest motor of the lot.

They ended up driving away in the basic model of the Q7 Sport.

The Real Madrid entourage did not go home without a little race using Audi’s Formula E simulator.

It was Dani Carvajal that came out on top, with Ramos and Marco Asensio finishing second and third.
