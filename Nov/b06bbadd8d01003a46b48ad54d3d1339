Pleased with the way the panel had conducted its proceedings, Falana was optimistic that the outcome of the panel would be satisfying to all the parties.

Falana reiterates, “I know the panel is made up of people of proven integrity and I know that based on the evidence before them, they will write reports and make appropriate recommendations in the interest of our country.

George observed, “We pray and hope that the report of this panel will not go down the drain, the whole world is waiting for the outcome of this panel.

“Everybody has been saying investigate and now the Federal Government has taken the bull by the horn, government has done the right thing by setting up this investigation.
