Two robbery suspects overpowered by their victim have been remanded in Katsina Prison.

A Katsina newspaper reported the suspects 20-year-old Danladi Auwalu and Yusuf Auwalu, 18,  were arrested for allegedly attempting to rob one Mati Shehu and his friend, Ibrahim Isah, at Babban Rafi Village, Danja Local Government Area of Katsina State.

The suspects with others at large were said to have attacked the victims who were riding on a motorcycle along Danja/Kano village road.

However, one of the victims, Shehu, had the upper hands over Danladi, and dragged him to the police station.

Another member of the robbery gang, Yusuf, was later arrested following police investigation.

Danladi and Yusuf were arraigned before a Katsina Senior Magistrates’ Court last Friday.

They were charged with criminal conspiracy, attempt to commit armed robbery and illegal possession of firearms.

Police prosecutor, Inspector Sani Ado, said the offences committed by Danladi and Yusuf were contrary to Section  6(b), 2 and 3(1) of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provision Act, Cap R11, LFN, 2004.

Ado, however, said investigation into the case was still in progress.

The presiding magistrate, Hajiya   Fadila Dikko, said that the charges against Danladi and Yusuf could only be tried by a high court.

She adjourned the case till Thursday for mention and directed that the two suspects should be remanded in the prison custody.
