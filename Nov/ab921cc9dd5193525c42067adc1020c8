Barcelona icon, Lionel Messi received his fourth Golden Shoe award on Friday after scoring more goals than any other player across all of Europe’s leagues last season.

It was the fourth time the Barcelona forward has received the honor, drawing him level with Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo.

Messi scored 37 goals in La Liga last season.

Messi has now got four Golden Shoe trophies — from 2009/10, 2011/12, 2012/13 and 2016/17

Thirty-year-old Messi also won the Golden Shoe in 2009-10 (34 goals), 2011-12 (50 goals) and 2012-13 (46 goals).

He was presented with the trophy by teammate Luis Suarez, who won the award in 2015-16 with 40 goals.

Messi thanked his teammates for helping him score so many goals, while also saying that he enjoys playing more than ever, 13 years since his debut with Barcelona’s first team.

‘I have never considered myself a forward. I have been lucky enough to score goals,’ Messi said.

‘I have grown both on and off the pitch. I keep improving and adding things to my game, and I enjoy playing more and more.’

The award is organised by European Sports Media, a group of newspapers and magazines

Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets also attended the ceremony in Barcelona.

Messi, Ronaldo and Suarez have dominated the award for the past nine years.

The only time a non-Spanish league player won the Golden Shoe in the last decade was when Suarez shared the prize with Ronaldo while at Liverpool in 2013-14.

The Golden Shoe is awarded by European Sports Media, an association of European sports newspapers and magazines.
