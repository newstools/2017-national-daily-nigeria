In what he called a significant milestone in th history of Kano,  Governor Abdullahi Ganduje said on Saturday  his administration has spent N208 million on the empowerment of  5,200 masu shayi (tea sellers) from the 44 LGAs in the state.

The  items distributed included cartons of noodles, cocoa beverage, liquid and powdered milk, tea, crates of eggs, nylon and cups, baskets, brown and white sugar, spaghetti and bread.

The ceremony was held at the Open Theatre,  Government House, Kano, where Ganduje said each of the beneficiaries would also receive N40,000 cash as take-off capital.

He said the effort would also boost the economic potential of the tea sellers and their families.

“We are empowering them because we want to increase their economic well-being. We are empowering you to improve the economy of Kano.
