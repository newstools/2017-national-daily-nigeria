After what appeared a long break, the Badoo cult struck again on Tuesday at Temu village in the Ikosi-Ejirin , Epe, Lagos, killing a mother and her two kids.

Iyabo and her children, aged 4 and 8, were reportedly killed while asleep around 2am on Tuesday at a Celestial Church of Christ parish, where they lived for about six months, in the neighbourhood.

The attackers scaled the fence to gain entry into the church and thereafter used a stone to smash their targets to death.

The woman’s husband was reportedly not around when the gang struck.

Neighbours said the trademark of the attack indicated that Badoo was back because there was a stone at the scene.

They wondered how the assailants got into the community despite security guards patrolling everywhere.

The incident wa reported to the police at the Agbowa Police Division, and the policemen from the division took the corpses away.

Police Public Relations Officer Olarinde Famous-Cole said a landlady and a commercial motorcycle rider had been arrested for the killings.

“A case of murder was reported at the Agbowa Police Station. The landlady and an okada rider (motorcyclist) who reside in the compound have been arrested and transferred to the homicide section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba,” he said, denying it was ritual killing.

“The era of ritual killings is gone in the state. Investigation is ongoing.”

A joint task force of security agency in Lagos carried out a raid on the suspected shrines and members of the dreaded group early in the year.

The joint operation was believed to have driven the cult underground all this while before the latest killing many attributed to it.
