The Arewa Consultative Forum and the Southern Kaduna Peoples’ Union have described as ‘wicked and barbaric’ the Friday night killing of four persons in Nimdem village of Godogodo Chiefdom in Jema’ah Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
The attack by an active shooter occured while the villagers were singing Christmas carols.
More than eight persons sustained injuries in addition to the dead.
The ACF condoled with the families affected, and called on security agents to be up and doing in their responsibility of protecting the lives and property of the residents of the area.
In a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the forum, Alhaji Muhammad Biu, the ACF stated it was “saddened by the unfortunate attack on innocent villagers holding a Christmas carol night at Nindem village of Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
“The dastardly act by the gunmen was wicked, barbaric and condemnable especially in this festive season of peace and stability.
“ACF calls upon the security agencies to be on the trail of these criminals and ensure that they are arrested and brought to justice.
“We equally appeal to the security agencies to provide adequate security especially to worshippers and their places of worship during the Christmas and also play grounds and parks.
The Southern Kaduna People Union (SOKAPU) also described the attack as unprovoked and most unfortunate.
SOKAPU’s spokesperson Yakubu Kuzamani recalled the December 24, 2016 attack on Goska which left several people dead. He wondered why a similar attack could occur under the watch of security operatives.
According to the union, no fewer than 16 communities in the southern part of the state were displaced following killings by herdsmen, kidnappers, cattle rustlers and armed robbers.
According to the union, most of the victims of the attacks are taking refuge at Kankomi, Udawa, Damba and Kasaya villages in Southern Kaduna.
