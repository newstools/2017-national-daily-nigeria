A 15-year-old Katsina housewife, identified as Dausiya Abdulmumini, has murdered her husband, Saminu Usman.
 
Usman, 27, and his half-brother, Muhammad Dasa, died after eating a meal she prepared, laced with poison, and served the brothers.
 
The incident was said to have happened on the December 18.
 
It was learnt that Dausiya’s sister-in-law, Shafa’atu Usman, 23, too ate the poisoned food, but missed death by a whisker.
 
However, she was rushed to the hospital and treated before discharged.
 
Katsina State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Gambo Isah, said the incident happened in Ungwar Dan Mayaki village in Bakori Local government area.
 
The PPRO further added that a good Samaritan had reported the matter at the Bakori Divisional Police Station.

 
Also, it was revealed that Dausiya was forced into the marriage, and she managed to have a heart for Usman early in the union. She later lost all feelings for him.

 
The teen-bride also had an accident some weeks to their wedding, losing her teeth and sustaining leg injuries. Many think these could have been responsible for the sudden hatred she had.
 
At the moment, Dausiya has been arrested and kept in police custody in Bakori.She would be charged with homicide and other offences. 
 
Teenage marriage has been going on for long in the north, though the elite there are beginning to decry the culture which is largely religious.
 
Emir of Kano Mohammed Sanusi in 2016 declared the practice as un-Islamic, pointing out how it has been violating the right of girl children in the region.
