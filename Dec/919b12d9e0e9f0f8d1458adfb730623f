As Plateau Governor Simon Bako Lalong hosted the victorious 2017/2018 NPFL champion Plateau United at the State House on recently, a FIFA match agent and NFF intermediary present said Lalong’s gesture to the team will push them all the way to make a strong statement in the February CAF Championship.
Femi Oladele, who was in Jos to fish out some talents to both Asia and Europe, told National Daily that excitement and readiness were written on the faces of the players and technical crew.
Oladele explained that his strong belief is tied to the fact that the moment a governor is seriously interested and involved in the affairs of a football team, his financial, fatherly and moral support will in return bring in success.
The NFF intermediary told National Daily that the owner of a firm called 90 Mins and Beyond Ltd, Okinawa, Japan, challenged the team to do Plateau State and Nigeria proud at the continental level if they still want more goodies from Lalong.
The governor rewarded Plateau United players with a sum of N1.5 million each for winning the Nigeria Professional Football League title last season.
Head coach of the club, Kennedy Boboye, also got N2.7 million for leading the Jos club to their first ever league title.
Boboye’s assistants and other members of the backroom staff shared N5.8m.
