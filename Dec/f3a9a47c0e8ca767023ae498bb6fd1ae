The Lagos State Government has commenced an extensive rehabilitation of major link roads across the State, including roads in and around the popular Ladipo market in continuation of its drive to ensure smooth flow of traffic in the area.

Deputy Director, Ministry of Works and Infrastructure, Mr. Sina Thorpe, in a statement on Sunday, said the Government in realizing the economic value of Ladipo Street which is a 2.87km road that connects Agege motor road to Apapa Oshodi Expressway service lane at Toyota Bus stop, decided to rehabilitate and upgrade the road to a dual carriage way by the Lagos State Government.Thorpe, who was responding to a report in a national daily of traders in the Ladipo Auto Spare Parts Market area lamenting the state of the roads, said the State Government was also rehabilitating and upgrading Alhaja Akinwunmi Street, a strategic road that connects Ladipo Street to Apapa Oshodi Expressway at Five Star Bus stop, including Obagun road, which links Badejo Kalejaiye street with Fatai Atere Way, which in turn connects Ladipo Street with Agege Motor Road.

He further added: “that to further ensure the interconnectivity to these network of roads and ease traffic in the corridor, part of the ongoing expansion and upgrading of the Oshodi International Airport Road would see the provision of a U-Turn ramped bridge to serve the motorists in the area.”

“The State Government therefore urged road users and commuters along the corridor to cooperate with the contractor in order to speedily deliver the road projects as scheduled, while mindful of their present albeit temporary discomfort.”
