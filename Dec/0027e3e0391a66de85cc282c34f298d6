Gov. Aminu Masari has described the recent defection of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as an exercise that won’t in any way affect the success of the ruling APC.
The Katsian governor said this on Monday in Maiadua where he received former Speaker (state assembly) Yau GojoGojo, who defected to APC from the PDP.
According to him, Atiku just answered his popular name. The former VP is known for roving from one party to another.
“The era of do or die politics was over as individual character and his performance speak for him in a political warfare, not unnecessary pride and display of wealth,” he said.

“We are set to receive more defectors into the party by next year as many influential members of the opposition would be joining us soon.”
Talking of his administration, the governor said, in the last two years, he constructed many roads, schools, hospitals and intensified efforts on security in the state.
Masari is one of the closest allies of President Muhammau Buhari whose state is Katsina. The former House of Rep Speaker has been tooting for Buhari’s second term.
