Advanced Peopleâ€™s Democratic Alliance (APDA) has felicitated with Nigerians at Christmas urging them to re-dedicate themselves to nation building and imbibe the virtues of Christ at Christmas and beyond.
The party equally appealed to Mr President to call on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Directorate of Petroleum Resources(DPR) to step up distribution of petroleum products to various filling stations and ensure compliance with lay down rules so as to avoid diversion of products across the country.
In a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Tosin Adeyanju, the party said it is imperative for Nigerians to work towards making the country greater by forging a common front to tackle the issues that divide instead of uniting them.
The party stated that as a movement on the march to greatness, APDA believes
working with all Nigerians, would make us Stronger Together.
