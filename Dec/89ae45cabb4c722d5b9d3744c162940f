Chelsea winger Eden Hazard has revealed that he regards Barcelona forward Lionel Messi as the best player in the world.

Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or award in four of the last five years, but Messi has helped Barcelona to an unbeaten start to the season in all competitions.

Hazard will come face to face with Messi when Chelsea face Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League in February, but the Belgian international insists that he is excited to compete against the Catalan giants.

The 26-year-old told Chelsea TV: “Of course, when you are playing football you want to play against the best. The best team, the best players in the world. Messi is the best player in the world.”

Hazard – who has two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract at Stamford Bridge – has been linked with a transfer to Real Madrid in the future.
