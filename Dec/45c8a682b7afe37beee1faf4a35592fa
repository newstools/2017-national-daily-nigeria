Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has got under his belt a PhD, in Christian Theology from the National Open University, NOUN.
Obasanjo was awarded the degree Friday after a rigorous defence of his thesis before a six-member panel at the Abeokuta Campus of the university where he was a student of the Department of Religious Studies, Faculty of Arts of the institution.
The chairman of the panel Samaila Mande said Obasanjo had put in “enough study” and “intellectual rigours” to produce his work based on diligent guide and supervision from his teachers and supervisors.
He also said it was a thing of joy that the former president was one of the pioneer students to bag PhD in Christian Theology under his management, an achievement that will be celebrated during the coming NOUN convocation.
Obasanjo’s PhD Thesis is entitled: “Resolving the Unfinished Agenda in Liberation Theology: Leadership, Poverty and Underdevelopment in North Eastern Nigeria.”
The panellists included Deji Ayegboyin (Major Supervisor), Mustapha Adejoro, (Head of Department, Religious Studies, NOUN), Nebath Tanglang (School of Postgraduate Studies), Samaila Mande (Dean, Postgraduate School), Godwin Akper (Internal Supervisor and Dean, Faculty of Arts) and Cletus Gotan (External Supervisor).
