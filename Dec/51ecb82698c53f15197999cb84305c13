President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday has asked authorities of Guinea Bissau to accept a constitutional way of resolving the crisis in the country as Nigeria will be pulling out its soldiers keeping peace in the country.
According to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said this while receiving the ECOWAS Commission’s President Marcel A. de Souza at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
Buhari was quoted as saying that he expected a formal report on the situation in Guinea Bissau at the 52nd Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government holding on Saturday in Abuja.

“We need our troops back home,” he said.
Buhari also commended the organisation for demanding accountability from its headquarters staff. The commission recently invited the EFCC to look into its books.
“Thanks for being firm, and for insisting on transparency and accountability at the ECOWAS headquarters,” Buhari said.
