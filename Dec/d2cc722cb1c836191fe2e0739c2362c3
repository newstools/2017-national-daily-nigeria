Nigeria’s top five Banks face hundreds of lawsuits every year that could potentially cost billions of Naira in claims, according to excerpts from the disclosures in annual reports of the banks.
The banks are sued in excess of billions of Naira by their customers, suppliers etc. for various reasons. Some get sued for excess bank charges, wrongful seizure of collateral, contract breaches, fraud etc.
The recent debacle between GT Bank and Innoson Motors which has since taken a life of its own had us look into bank annual reports to determine just how much law suits banks face.
As part of their risk disclosures, Banks are by statutory provisions, required to disclose law suits in their annual reports and give an opinion on the severity of the law suit and how much the bank could be made to pay in damages should the law suits go against them.
First Bank Group is a party to a number of legal actions arising out of its normal business operations. There were contingent liabilities in respect of legal liabilities against the group, for which provisions amounting to N2.91 billion have been made (2015: N542.81 million).
UBA in the ordinary course of business is currently involved in 650 legal cases (2015: 577). The total amount claimed in the cases against the Bank is estimated at N486.92 billion (2015: N443.4 billion).
