The Acting Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr. Abdul Zubair has restated his commitment to workers welfare in order to ensure peace and harmony in the organization.
Zubair said this when he received executive members of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) led by its Secretary General Comrade Isaac Ojemhanke in Abuja, Monday.
The Acting Director General expressed the readiness of the present Management to partner with the Trade Union in a bid to make the working environment peaceful and ensure that the regulator is able to carry out its responsibilities without let or hindrance.
According to Zubair, “We are pleased to partner with you and we are extending our hands of fellowship. We do not want confrontation; we are willing to partner with the union to fashion a way forward”
“We take the Union in high esteem, we are here to listen and be ready to work with you”.
Speaking earlier, Ojemhanke said the union believes that the organization has to exist for there to be a Trade Union, hence all efforts to ensure that there is peace and harmony within organizations.
“There must be survival of the organization; if the organization does not survive there would be no union. We are here to partner with the management, we will partner with the SEC once the management is ready to play by the rules” Ojemhanke said.
He commended the Acting DG for his efforts so far, especially steps taken to boost morale and improve industrial harmony in the Commission, adding that the parent body would always support the Management in that direction.
