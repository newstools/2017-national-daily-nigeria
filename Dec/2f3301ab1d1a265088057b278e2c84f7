Pep Guardiola has been awarded Premier League Manager of the Month for the third consecutive month after his Manchester City side won all four of their matches in November.
Guardiolaâ€™s men recorded wins over Arsenal, Leicester, Huddersfield and Southampton last month as City continued their outstanding start to the season.
The City boss also scooped the gong in September and October, as his side embarked on their record-breaking run of 15 successive league wins.
Guardiola beat out competition from Antonio Conte, Sean Dyche, Jose Mourinho, Jurgen Klopp and Arsene Wenger to land the November award.
