Cristiano Ronaldo has made a huge demand to Real Madrid which also involves arch-rival, Lionel Messi

Ronaldo scored a free-kick which went through the defensive wall to break Gremio’s brave resistance and give Real Madrid a 1-0 victory in the final.

It secured Real their second world title in a row, the third in the last four seasons, and ended Gremio’s hopes of pulling off what would have been a huge upset.

Ronaldo currently earns £18.5million a year at Real but arch rival Messi, the man he beat to this year’s Ballon d’Or, is on £26.4m.

That followed a new huge contract that Messi signed with Barcelona last month.

Spanish newspaper Marca put a huge picture of Ronaldo on their front page this morning with the headline: “Cristiano quiere mas”. That translates to “Cristiano wants more.”

They state that Ronaldo now wants the same salary Messi or Neymar which would equate to a near 50 per cent pay rise.

The front page of Marca today claimed Ronaldo wants a pay-rise
Marca state, however, that Real will not yet open negotiations.

Ronaldo signed a new five-year deal last year but he insisted then that would not be his last.

The Portuguese superstar, 33, was hailed by his team-mates after firing Real to Club World Cup success.

Substitute Lucas Vazquez told his club’s official website after the Abu Dhabi success: “Before the game, I told Cristiano I was sure he was going to score and that’s why he ran to me for the celebration.

“We’re thrilled. It’s a team success and I hope we can improve on it in 2018.”
