In the on-going series on President Muhammadu Buhari’s other side Nigerians have not known, aides and associates of the president have been giving accounts of many parts of the 75-year-old.
His foremost supporter Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai revealed he and some other people used to laugh their heads off listening to Buhari’s riddles in his Daura home when they were in opposition. But that has stopped since they have been in government.
The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, made excerpts of the interviews in the documentary, meant to show the other side of Buhari on air between December 24 and 26..
Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo was also confirmed that Buhari cracks jokes and the whips at the same time.
“He gives you things to do and leaves you strictly to do those things. No interference at all, once he has confidence in you… And he cracks those jokes, and manages to still keep a straight face,” Osinbajo said.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Diaspora Matters, Abike Dabiri-Erewa also gave her takes.
“How I wish Nigerians know his softer and accommodating side. Very jocular. But it is our duty to tell them,” she said.
Ogun Gov. Ibikunke Amosun described him as a “reformed democrat.”
“I wish I had his patience. He would listen to everybody and then take a decision. He is a reformed democrat,” the governor said.
Minister of Power, Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola, said Buhari gave him some priority projects: Mokwa/Jebba road, Lagos/Ibadan Expressway, and Second Niger Bridge…
“He never appends his signature to anything, unless you’ve explained, and he understands it,” he said.
The showpiece was put together by the presidential media handlers.
