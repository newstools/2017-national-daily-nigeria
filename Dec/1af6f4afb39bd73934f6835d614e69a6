“Her contributions to the development of education in particular in the state cannot be over emphasised.
“During her term as commissioner, schools were rehabilitated and upgraded, new ones were constructed, teachers were trained and the atmosphere made more conducive for learning and teaching.
“However, as political activities for the 2019 general elections are about to commence, it becomes imperative for government to bring more active politicians on board to fasten activities of governance,’’ Masari said.
The governor wished Prof. Halimatu, Allah’s guidance in her future endeavours.
