Furthermore, LASTMA officials on duty are always in uniforms with names conspicuously displayed on the breast pockets and motorists should disregard anybody not in uniform claiming to be Agency officials.He said such person in mufti should be reported to LASTMA or nearest law enforcement Agency, adding that any motorist dealing with the state traffic official should feel free to demand for his identity and name.Musa urged motorists and members of the public to take advantage of the open door policy of the Agency to make complaints against any erring officer, and as such complains would not only be treated with dispatch, but also make sure justice is done.The LASTMA boss therefore urged motorists to exhaust all avenues available to seek redress before approaching media, as any officer found wanting on duty would be dealt with according to the service rules and regulation.“I want to assure motorists that we have put everything in place to ensure free flow of traffic during the yuletide period and I want to implore motorists to imbibe the culture of voluntary compliance with traffic officials directives, obey road signs and laws so that we can have seamless traffic during this yuletide period,” Musa said.It would be recalled that over 20 officials of the Agency have been dismissed this year for various act of misconduct that were considered to be inimical to the service of the state and Agency.This is in addition to dozens of other officials that have received various letters of warning and those that are waiting their turn to appear before Personal Management Board (discipline) for various unwholesome act and behaviour.
