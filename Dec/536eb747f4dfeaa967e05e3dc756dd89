The APC has officially responded to the Sunday return of ex-VP Atiku Abubakar to the PDP.
The ruling party said it would solve its problems without the former vice president that since the PDP had been able to “solve its problems” without Atiku.
According to the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi whi spole to the Punch on the phone, If Abubakar has found PDP attractive now because they have solved their problems, it means the APC also solve their problems without him.
“Then he can come back to our party.”
He added that Abubakr’s complaints about his disappointments within the APC would have carried more weight if he was still a member.
“I believe that if the former vice-president had spoken out when he was in the party, perhaps, we would have made progress in that respect,” Abdullahi said.

“To now begin to speak after he has left the party shows that there are some things that he should have done that he didn’t do.”
On the challenge that Atiku will defeat President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019, Abdullahi said Buhari’s integrity that made Nigerians vote for him in 2015 is still intact, and on that ground, he will win if he contests.
“They voted President Buhari because they needed a leader who has integrity, strong on corruption and capable of defeating Boko Haram. If he stands for election in 2019, we believe Nigerians would still vote for him,” he said.
Buhari himself has not said anything about his ambition for 2019, and the silence has been generating speculations, which are among the reasons Abubakar quickly defected to PDP in case the president decides to contest.
This is the third time the former president will be returning to the former ruling party in about 18 years.
