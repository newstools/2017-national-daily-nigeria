The Ahmed Makarfi National Caretaker Committee of the PDP has revealed the faction went broke because governors and deep pockets in the party are not ready to dump money in its coffer since the party is not a personal empire of anybody.

The faction’s publicity secretary, Dayo Adeyeye, said this on Monday at a press conference in Abuja. According to him, the situation is bad “so much so that simple secretariat duties have been a struggle while we have been unable to pay staff salaries of just N18 million a month”.

“Our only regret is that these (members’) contributions have not been forthcoming as expected, giving the heavy weight of responsibilities placed before us and especially the burden of having to deal with distractions caused by Senator Sheriff and his cohorts,” he said.
Many will find Adeyeye’s statement a hard one to swallow, looking at the zeal and efforts of certain party men like Governors Ayo Fayose, Nyesom Wike, Seriake Dickson, and others. Fayose is the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, and self-appointed party leader in the southwest.

The Ali Modu Sheriff faction claimed earlier that Makarfi and his men receive a monthly dole-out of N50 million from the PDP governors so the party officials won’t the crisis settled.

An appeal court recently upheld the legitimacy of Sheriff as the party chairman. The other faction, has, however, gone to Supreme Court to challenge the appellate court decision.
Responding to the allegation by Ojuigo Cairo, the vice chairman to Sheriff, Adeyeye challenged their opponents to account for $1 million and vehicles Sheriff has taken from the ruling APC.
