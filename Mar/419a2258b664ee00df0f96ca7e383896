It was also learnt that following the surge of cases, Police operatives raised the alarm over the week that members of the public should give the organization cogent information that would assist in cracking the kidnap gang.

Olayemi, a National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) who spoke to National Daily said that most of the victims are people that board vehicle along the road during wee hours of the day.

Narrating her ordeals on how she escaped from the hands of the criminal gang,  Mrs Bukola James, a civil servant, said God spared her live three weeks ago when she boarded a commercial bus popularly called Danfo on her way to Ikeja.

“I was going to my office about 9.30am on the fateful day when I encountered them. We were two in the bus stop when the bus arrived. Immediately I entered, the driver told the conductor to move it was a female passenger because that was  what they wanted.

“Unfortunately for them, they did not wind up the glass I brought my head and hand out and raised alarm and they immediately dropped me off and zoomed off,” she narrated.
