The operatives of Rapid Response Squad of the Lagos State Police Command, over the weekend, arrested three suspected kidnappers who fled Ibadan to Lagos after collecting N3 million ransom from a victim.

The kidnappers, Adekunle Funsho,31, Charles Ezeilo, 32, and Obioha Nnaji were apprehended at Abule Egba, Lagos, after kidnapping a lady and collecting N3 million ransom.

The National Daily learnt the police in Ibadan, after discovering that the kidnappers were heading to Lagos in the victim’s Toyota Highlander, had radioed Lagos command for assistance.

It was gathered that when RRS officials received the radio signal, they tracked the vehicle to Fela Shrine in Ikeja, from where the alleged suspects further moved the vehicle to a compound in Abule Egba, Lagos.

National Daily further learnt that one of the suspects was arrested before recovering the Toyota Highlander 2005 model with the registration number LND 954 EE.

Subsequently, it was gathered, the arrest of the first suspect led to the arrest of another suspect who was later apprehended at Fela’s Shrine in Ikeja while another suspect simply identified as Theophilus is on the run.

Confessing, Funsho, a fashion designer around Felele, Ibadan, where the kidnapping took place said, “Theophilus handed over the car to me in Ibadan and told me to look for a buyer. I brought the car to Lagos because I know that I would get a buyer quickly for the car.

“He asked me to sell the Highlander at N800, 000:00 and I took the car to him along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, where he paid me before he took the car away.

The case has been investigated by the Anti-kidnapping team of the Oyo State Police Command, for further investigation
