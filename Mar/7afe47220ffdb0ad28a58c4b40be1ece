The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Mathew Hassan Kukah has come down on those saying he was close to former President Goodluck Jonathan for what he could get from the politician.

Kukah, the current edition of The Interview, said those who thought they could smear him by warming up to President Muhammadu Buhari were responsible for fantasizing his relationship with Jonathan.

“Despite my friendship with Jonathan over this long period of time, we never discussed a penny, we never discussed one dollar; we never exchanged a penny, and we never exchanged a dollar,” Kukah said.

“Suddenly, journalists whom I knew were writing, hoping they would be given positions (by Buhari) and all those who were abusing me have gone full cycle,” he said.

According to him, those who should be ashamed of themselves are those who took money from Jonathan, tons of it, and have decided to lie, buried under the table.

“They have decided to change course in the middle of the race. Those are the guys who you should be talking about.”

The clergyman revealed that “certain people in the PDP” have been telling him that Jonathan should have had a long-drawn-out exit, like the disgraced Gambian President Yahaya Jammeh.
