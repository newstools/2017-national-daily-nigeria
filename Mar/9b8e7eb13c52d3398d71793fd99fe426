Prof. Wole Soyinka has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to release his medical records.
“He’s ill, there’s no question, and I wish for heaven’s sake that people in public positions would just be honest, Soyinka said in Paris over the weekend.
“Illness is part of our existence. Buhari owes it to the nation and I don’t know why he and his advisors are being so coy about it,” Soyinka told AFP.
President Muhammadu Buhari, speaking to dignitaries in Abuja, after returning from a seven-week medical leave in the UK, said that he has never been “so sick” as he has felt in recent weeks.
His absence led to some anxiety in the country with people speculating about the president’s ill-health.
