The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has vowed to embark on strike from Monday, April 3, 2017.

The NUPENG National President, Comrade (Dr) Achese Igwe, who made this known on Friday during the press briefing, held in Lagos, cited the serious plights members of the tanker drivers have been going through as one of the reasons for the strike.

According to him, “The Central Working Committee (CWC), in session examined the various complaints and agitations of Petroleum Tanker Drivers members of NUPENG over their deplorable working conditions with regards to poor remuneration, insecurity on highways, poor state of roads, absence of conducive rest places on the highways and the excesses of some security agencies, most especially the Nigeria Civil Defence Corps.

“The CWC-m-session considered inhumane, the refusal of National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) to commence negotiation with the union for the renewal of expired collective bargaining agreement (CBA) on the working conditions of our tanker drivers members in PTD branch after several appeals and even ultimatum.”

In addition, Achese stated “that the CWC-in-session therefore resolved to give full baking to any industrial action the members in the sector might decide to take with effect from Monday, April 3, 2017.

“To avert the pains and discomfort the action might cause, the CWC-in-session calls on the Federal Government to urgently intervene and apprehend the unfortunate situation to enable NARTO  meets the obligations to tankers drivers.”
