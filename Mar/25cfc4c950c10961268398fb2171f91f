After long awaited expectation by industry watchers, Federal Government finally appointed interim Managing Director / CEO and Executive Directors for the Bank of Agriculture (BOA).
Approving the appointment, President Muhammadu Buhari  said the appointment was Federal Government’s determination to reposition the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) to be a more efficient and result-oriented institution.
The strategic re-positioning of BOA will enhance farmers easy accessibility to agricultural funds that will be profitable for large and local farmers hoping to expand their farms.
Availability of funds will no doubt increase production which will eventually result in self-sufficiency.
It would be recalled that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo during the launch of the Agricultural Road Map, said that plans were ongoing to recapitalise the Bank of Agriculture.
The appointees are as follows, Kabiru Mohammed, Director/CEO, Prince Akenzua, Executive Director Corporate Finance, Dr Okenwa Gabriel, Executive Director, Partnership and Strategy.  Others are Ameh Owoicho, Executive Director, Credit and Empowerment, Bode Abikoye, Executive Director, Credit Empowerment.
