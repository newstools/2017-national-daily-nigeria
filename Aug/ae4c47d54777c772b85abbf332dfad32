Controversial Kogi state senator Dino Melaye is in the news again, this time with a hilarious twist!
The Senator whose hit track ‘Ajekun Iya’ is no longer enjoying massive airplay has found another way to break the internet, albeit unknowingly.
Melaye who is known to be a sharp dresser often posted a cool photo of himself sitting demurely in a hotel room outside Nigeria. What the Senator, however, failed to do before posting was to double check the photo for ‘imperfections’!

He posted and Nigerians were fast to spot this huge imperfection!
A lady was sitting smugly on the bed with her black leather bag by her legs. Although the lady’s face didn’t make an appearance, her legs did.
Meanwhile, Nigerians are speculating that since it wasn’t a selfie, the shot was most likely taken by another lady and with this insinuation, the minds of many Nigerians flew into the gutter and these reactions flooded the internet.
