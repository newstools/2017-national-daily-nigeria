Former President Goodluck Jonathan said on Tuesday that the thieves that burgled his house in Abuja stripped it of every movable item.

While reacting to the theft through his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, Jonathan explained that he bought the house, “a modest 4-bedroom duplex”, in 2004 and is located at Gwarimpa, Abuja.




Eze disclosed in a statement that six television sets, three refrigerators and one gas cooker were stolen against media reports that said 36 units of plasma television sets and 25 refrigerators were stolen in the house.

Eze reiterated that the house was completely stripped bare by the thieves who stole furniture sets, beds, electronics, toilet and electrical fittings, as well as all internal doors and frames.

It was gathered that the theft was discovered in July but was immediately reported to the police authorities for investigation.

It was further learnt that police swung into extensive investigations which led to the arrest and detention of some suspects, including six policemen.

Eze, however, disclosed that former President Jonathan bought the house in 2004 from CITEC Estate Developers.
