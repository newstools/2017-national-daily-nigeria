New research has revealed that men whoare exposed to pornographic materials at early age are likely to desire power over women.

The American Psychological Association experts noted that “that’s a problem.”

The study co-author, Alyssa Bischmann said, “We found that the younger a man was when he first viewed pornography, the more likely he was to want power over women.”

Alyssa spoke at the presentation of the findings to the APA at the organisation’s annual conference.

Bischmann’s study surveyed 330 undergraduate male and found that the average scholar saw their first porn at age 13.

The researchers also found that men who discovered porn later in life were more likely to pursue the promiscuous playboy lifestyle.

They also found that “men who saw porn earlier in life were more prone to answering questions on masculinity that indicated an inclination to assert themselves over women.”

The researchers are hopeful that the findings can “inform sexual assault prevention efforts, especially in a youth generation with the World Wide Web at their fingertips.”
