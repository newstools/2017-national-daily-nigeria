4 South African men, including an ANC Ward Councilor who appeared at the Estcourt Magistrate’s Court Monday, are now facing cannibalism charges after one of them reportedly walked into a police station, to confess he’s “tired” of eating human flesh.
Upon questioning, he produced part of a human leg and hand, and then led thePolice to a house in KwaZulu-Natal where more body parts were found.

It was also gathered that apart from the cannibalism charge, they were also charged with murder and conspiracy to murder.
Though the Police is still investigating the claims, Police Spokesperson alleged that the four young men, aged between 22 and 32 years old, are part of a bigger syndicate, as they further urged people whose relatives have disappeared in the vicinity of Estcourt to come forward, while a team of forensic experts has been called in to identify the remains, as it is not clear whether the body parts belong to one or several victims.
