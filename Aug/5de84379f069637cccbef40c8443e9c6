Paris St-Germain are continuing negotiations to sign teenage forward Kylian Mbappe for £166m before the transfer window closes on Thursday, but his club, Monaco, would prefer to sell the 18-year-old to Real Madrid.

However, everyone one was shocked to read that Madrid had diverted their attention from Mbappe to Leo Messi. As it was Twitted off the Spanish twitter account that they are now hoping to receive the Argentine play maker.

But the call for Leo Messi has been quickly refuted by the Spanish giant as they claim that their official Twitter account was hacked.

In the event Mbappe does leave Monaco, the French club are viewing Leicester City’s Algerian striker Islam Slimani as a replacement, with Newcastle and Watford also weighing up a move for the 29-year-old.

Other reports suggests PSG have concluded an agreement with Monaco defensive midfielder Fabinho, 23, from the Ligue 1 champions.
