In the letter to August
, they urged her not spend her childhood “worrying too much about the future”.
“When your sister was born, we wrote a letter about the world we hoped she and now you will grow up in — a world with better education, fewer diseases, stronger communities, and greater equality,” the parents said.
“But rather than write about growing up, we want to talk about childhood. The world can be a serious place. That’s why it’s important to make time to go outside and play.”
“Childhood is magical. You only get to be a child once, so don’t spend it worrying too much about the future,” the pair wrote for August.
“You’ve got us for that, and we’ll do everything we possibly can to make sure the world is a better place for you and all children in your generation.”
