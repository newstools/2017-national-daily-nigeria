The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has launched a consumer web portal to provide information and education resources for telecoms subscribers in the country.
“The Nigerian Communications Commission Consumer Web Portal is up and running as a platform for information and education resources that telecom consumers may require taking informed decisions,” a Facebook post by the Commission read.
“Telecom consumers are encouraged to use the platform to lodge complaints, make enquiries, as well as suggestions on how to improve on the quality of telecom service provision,” it further stated.

The Commission is responsible for creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunications services throughout the country.
The Consumer Affairs Bureau is one of the key departments of the Nigerian Communications Commission. It was created in September 2001 by the Commission through the provision of Chapter VII of Nigerian Communications Act (NCA 2003), in particular, Part I of the chapter which deals with Consumer Protection and Quality of Service.
On the NCC newly launched consumer web portal, telecoms subscribers can learn about consumer issues, file a complaint or check complaint status.
By filing a consumer complaint with the NCC, the regulators say, consumers are contributing to federal enforcement and consumer protection efforts on a national scale.
