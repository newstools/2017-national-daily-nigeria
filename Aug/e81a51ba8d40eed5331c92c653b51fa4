He had narrated: “They invaded our village late Saturday night, when many had gone to bed and several young men were still outside. But everyone was rattled by the sporadic gunshots.
“No one was expecting such because the people have been living in peace, hence, the sound of gunshots sent fears into everyone and people started running for their lives. The siege lasted few minutes.
“Unfortunately, when the gang left, we later discovered that the victim was killed in the confusion, while some other persons sustained bullet wounds, including the 14-year-old son of the deceased.
“His remains have been deposited at the General Hospital, while the injured persons, including his son, are receiving treatment at the same hospital.”
