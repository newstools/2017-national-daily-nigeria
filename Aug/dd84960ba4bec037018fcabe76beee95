Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a scathing criticism of the UN on Monday as the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, began his first visit to the country.
At the opening remarks of Netanyahu’s meeting with the UN chief, the prime minister accused the UN of failing to prevent arms shipments to the Shi’ite militant group Hezoballah in Lebanon.
He added, that Iran is seeking to open a front against Israelbon the Lebanese and Syrian borders.

“[Iran] is also building sites to produce precision-guided missiles towards that end in both Syria and in Lebanon.
“This is something Israel cannot accept. This is something the UN should not accept,” Netanyahu said, without offering specifics.
Iran and Hezbollah are fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government in the Syrian civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands.
The prime minister added that he believes the UN has an “absurd obsession” with his country.
