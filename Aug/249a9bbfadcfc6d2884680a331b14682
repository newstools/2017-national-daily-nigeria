You are probably making it easy on them ignorantly.
So, we’re really not trying to scaremonger your every day life but we already know the insane (but sensible) reason why you should never do the peace sign in photos and what you should never do to your luggage – despite us all being guilty of it.


And now, security specialists are telling us to be very careful what we post on social media, too.
The last thing you need when you’re on holiday is to worry about anything happening at home so make sure you’re not advertising any information about being away on your social media feeds.
Together Mutual Insurance have formulated a study that shows over 1,500,000 social posts shared have included sensitive information about people’s holidays including airport check-ins, photos of boarding passes or passports and locations of where you’re headed to (with a clue of how long you’re going to be away.

In the last 30 days, the study also showed that 66,000 British holidayers had discussed their exact holiday itineraries with others on Twitter.
It might seem obvious, but never post an image of your passport or boarding pass – or anything that might
have your address on it as you’re just advertising the fact that your house is going to be empty.
And, according to National Daily, 78% of burglars use social media channels like Facebook, Foursquare and Twitter to decide who to target. On top of this, 75% of them use Google Street View to get to know your home better first, too.
