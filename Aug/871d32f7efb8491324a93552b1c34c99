“The new minimum level will now be £100,000. Top up your savings and investments to £100,000 or more before 1 August 2017, to continue with the service, or close your account and transfer your monies to another provider without charge,” the letter read.
“We understand that you may be disappointed by this and we will aim to offer you as much assistance as possible during this transition period.”
In 2013, the bank announced that it would focus on 70 countries globally and customers in those that are not considered as core as others.
