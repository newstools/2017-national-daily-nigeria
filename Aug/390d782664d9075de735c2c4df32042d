Marine experts have attempted to shed some light on why a teenager was left with bleeding legs after being attacked by tiny organisms as he paddled at an Australia beach.
Sam Kanizay was standing in the shallows when he felt the creatures attack on Brighton beach, Melbourne.
The 16-year-old was left with blood pouring from the pinhole size wounds on his lower legs, but marine biologists said the incident had been “bad luck” and the creatures posed no risk to the general public.

Sam’s father Jarrod Kanizay said hospital staff had no idea what kind of creature could have caused the injuries, so he went back to the beach the following night with a pool net full of meat and captured the animals he believes could have been responsible.
Mr Kanizay took a video of dozens of the tiny bug-like creatures scrabbling to feed on the chunks of meat.
“What is really clear is these little things really love meat,” he said.
