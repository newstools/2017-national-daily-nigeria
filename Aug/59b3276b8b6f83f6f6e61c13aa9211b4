The Lagos State House of Assembly Committee on Education has urged contractors handling model colleges building projects in Awori College, Lagos City Model College and Angus Memorial College to expedite work in the schools.

Chairman of the House Committee on Education, Hon. Olanrewaju Ogunyemi, who led other members of the committee to the project sites stressed that  the projects were important and ambitious.

Ogunyemi said that they were giant strides of the administration of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode.

“The model colleges visited would have 26 classrooms each, they would have laboratories and other facilities. These are world class facilities that befit a model college.

“The essence of the visit is to assess the projects based on the desire of the government.

“We have visited the three model colleges that ought to be pilots for other model colleges in the state.

“We are pleased with what we saw at Angus and Lagos City Model College, Kings Country Project, but we are unhappy with what the contractor at Awori College, Eldorado Engineering, did after collecting 40% of the fund.”

The lawmaker however, expressed optimism that if given the necessary back up, the contractors handling Angus and Lagos City Model College would do their best within the one year specified for the completion of the project.

Ogunyemi stated that the committee would give feedback to the assembly on the visit, adding that the projects would enable school children to learn under a conducive environment.

He noted that :”Given the passion government has shown on the projects, we feel that we should see what the contractors have done so far.

“We are concerned about infrastructure in our schools and we believe that these are unique projects that should attract our attention.”
