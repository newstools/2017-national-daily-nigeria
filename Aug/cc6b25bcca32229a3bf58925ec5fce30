The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association has partnered the Imagine Business Services to unveil NECAPreneur, an entrepreneurship e-learning programme.
The association said the programme was part of its continued efforts to join hands with the government to address the high unemployment rate among Nigerian youths which was recently put at 80 per cent by the Central Bank of Nigeria.
NECA described the initiative as an e-solution targeted at providing an easy-to-access opportunity for the teeming Nigerian youths to upscale their skills and discourage them from relying solely on white-collar jobs.

The Director- General, NECA, Mr. Olusegun Oshinowo, while speaking in Lagos, condemned the idleness of the teeming youths, a situation he said had made them available as ready tools for social ills.
The DG said, “The initiative is in tandem with NECA’s mandate to influence economic and socio-labour policies to create an army of gainfully employed youths, who in turn would be employers of labour and ultimately add to national development. The target is getting youths to be wealth creators rather than job seekers.
