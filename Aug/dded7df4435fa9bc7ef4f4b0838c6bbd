Vice President of Nigeria, Yemi Osinbajo has declared that President Muhammadu Buhari’s return from his long-term medical vacation in London is a sign of good things to come for the country’s economy.
“The recovery of Mr President, in some senses, is symbolic of the recovery of Nigeria,” Osinbajo said on Saturday.
It will be recalled the president left Nigeria on May 7 for London for the second round of treatment for an undisclosed ailment, thereby transferring power to the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo to lead the most populous African country.
 His absence in Nigeria since May 7 has however caused for rounds of protests and calls for him to resume or resign.

There is also a growing level of disenchantment with his government which came to power in May 2015 on the wings of promises to restabilise the country by fighting against corruption, improving security and improving the economy.

However, while substantial progress has been recorded in the fight against insurgency in northeast Nigeria and corruption, the country’s economy is in the throes of a stubborn recession that has led to the death of many businesses while inflation continues to rise.

But Osinbajo, who stood in for recuperating Buhari, insisted that the country’s economy would rebound, noting that the government is working to “ensure economic recovery.”
“Our country is on the right track,” Osinbajo said assuring that “we are going to make it as a nation.”
