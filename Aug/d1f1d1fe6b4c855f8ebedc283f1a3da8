The source was said to have narrated: “When the kidnappers came for her, there was no other way they could gain entrance into her house because of security. So, they used the ceiling and took her last Friday. But she was released three days later after an undisclosed amount was paid.”
The Police Public Relations Officer, Irene Ugbo, was gathered to have confirmed the arrest, admitting that they have two people in custody who have confessed to kidnapping a woman at Ikot Ansa. She said: “It is true that we have two people who were arrested by Operation Skolombo for kidnapping and handed over us. Investigation is ongoing because we know there is more to this particular group and we shall leave no stone unturned.”
