Ahmed Makarfi, National Caretaker Committee of the People’s Democratic Party has disclosed about the ongoing plans to lure back ex-president, Olusegun Obasanjo, Senate President Bukola Saraki and once vice-president, Atiku Abubakar to the party.
Speaking with Sunday Punch, Makarfi stated that a peace committee has been inaugurated at national and zonal levels to that effect.
 “There is a plan to mobilise many people. We inaugurated the peace committee at the national and zonal levels and we have given them terms of reference to their work in terms of reconciliation and mobilisation. We hope they succeed in wooing these people back to the PDP,” he said.

Concerning the 2019 presidential elections, Makarfi said: “the PDP will field a strong candidate from the North to face (President Muhammadu) Buhari or whoever the APC presents. He asserted that Buhari must go in 2019.
“I honestly don’t see him winning a second term because we have concluded plans to defeat the APC in 2019. I believe the PDP will win that presidential election once we field a good candidate”, he said.
