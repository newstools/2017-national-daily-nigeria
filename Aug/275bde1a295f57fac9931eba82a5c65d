The apex Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, has expressed the view that restructuring Nigeria will give the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) over the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019.
Leaders of the Afenifere, on Sunday, August 20, through Yinka Odumakin, National Publicity Secretary, maintained that APC’s restructuring of the country will reduce the opposition party to nothing, saying that the PDP will have nothing to put up during its campaigns for 2019 general elections.
Odumakin had declared: ”The APC has the edge; they are in powe now, while the PDP is in the opposition. Let the APC do restructuring so that the PDP will have nothing to campaign.

 ”Instead of fighting the PDP because they are calling for restructuring, the APC should do restructuring so that the PDP will have nothing to campaign with except they, APC, are just doing cheap propaganda.
“That is the best way for them to treat PDP; restructure Nigeria.Then PDP will look for something else to campaign with”
National Daily had earlier reported Odumakin warning that if Nigeria does restructure itself, it is certain that the relations among the east, north, west and south will come to an end.
