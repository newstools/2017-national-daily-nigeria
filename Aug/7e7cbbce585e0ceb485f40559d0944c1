Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off after helping Real Madrid secure a 3-1 win at Barcelona in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday.
Ronaldo scored with a beautiful strike to make it 2-1 in the 80th minute and earned a yellow card for taking off his shirt to flex his muscles at Camp Nou.
Ronaldo will miss Wednesday’s second leg in Madrid after being booked again just two minutes after scoring for diving in the area.
