Music and entertainment maverick Charles Oputa, a.k.a Charly Boy, and others have suspended protest in Abuja demanding for the extradition of ex-Petroleum Minister Diezani Allison-Madueke.

National Daily gathered that the duo of Charly Boy, Adeyanju, and others suspended the protest a day after members of the group got assurances from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) that Diezani would be repatriated soon.

To fast track her extradition, it was learnt EFCC were working with the Ministry of Justice to ensure that Allison-Madueke is sent back to Nigeria on time to face allegations of corruption against her.

However, as the group are suspending protest in Abuja, the group is expected to resume protests at 10 Downing street Westminster London, the headquarters and seat of Government of the United Kingdom within the week.

The co-convener of the protest, Deji Adeyanju said in Abuja that “Before this week runs out, our comrades in the United Kingdom are going to stage a protest at the entrance of 10, Downing Street to drive home the point of ‘Bring Back Diezani.”

“We will appeal to the British Government saying ‘if Diezani Allison-Madueke is just allowed to be prosecuted in London, it will merely amount to a pat on the back’, because her contravention of the British laws and the punishments therein are minor compared to what awaits her here in Nigeria.

“As we speak, the plan for the London protest is in top gear. We are also mindful of the fact that she is slated to appear before a British court in September. We are also planning something for court appearances in the UK.”
