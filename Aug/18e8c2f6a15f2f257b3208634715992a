Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president Amaju Pinnick has called on Nigerians to pray for the Super Eagles as the date for their all-important 2018 World Cup qualifying fixtures draw nearer.
Nigeria, top of Group B with six points, play against Cameroon (two points) on September 1 in Uyo, and then travel to Yaounde for the reverse fixture at Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo on September 4.
Pinnick affirmed that the NFF have done everything they need to do to put the Super Eagles in the right frame for the double-header.

“We are ready (for Cameroon). After the South Africa loss, we regrouped immediately and looked at some of the challenges. The technical committee looked at the things we needed to do”
“We have done everything we should do – plane tickets, hotels etc. All we are asking is that Nigerians should pray for us”, Amaju told National Daily.
NFF President believes with every other important detail taken care of, prayers are what the Super Eagles need to overcome second placed Cameroon over two legs.
Nigeria last played Cameroon in October 2015, beating the African champions 3-0 in an international friendly.
