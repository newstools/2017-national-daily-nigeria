Unknown gunmen, on Wednesday, attacked the headquarters of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abuja, but failed to invade the premises.
Wilson Uwajaren, EFCC spokesman, said they were not able to make their way into the complex as the security guards on duty repelled them.
Uwajaren narrated that the group of heavily armed bandits entered the premises of the Commission at about 05.00 hours and began shooting, damaging vehicles.

He affirmed that, however, the attack was repelled by guards on duty. “The hoodlums escaped in a getaway vehicle but not without leaving a message; a white envelope dropped by the fleeing attackers was found to contain a death threat addressed to Ishaku Sharu, a senior investigator with the Commission,” he said.
Ishaku, who heads the foreign exchange malpractices fraud section, is in charge of corruption investigation involving several politically exposed persons and retired military brass hats. “The attack on the Zone 7 office which houses the commission’s AMCON desk, procurement fraud and foreign exchange malpractices sections, is coming few weeks after another investigator, Austin Okwor, was shot and wounded by unknown assailants in Port Harcourt, Rivers state,” EFCC revealed.
