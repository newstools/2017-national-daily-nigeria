The four suspects were killed by a mob at Tella in Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba.
Misal explained that the mob were arrested by a local vigilance group but the mob forcefully took them from the vigilante station at Tella and hacked them to death.

‘They were arrested by a local vigilance group, but before being handed over to the police, a group of irate youths lynched them and threw their bodies into the river.

“One of the suspects escaped and was later arrested in Jalingo. He is presently in our custody,” he said.

Confessing to the alleged crime, Zakari, claimed that the syndicate were not kidnappers but actually went to Tella for armed robbery before they were arrested by the vigilante group.
