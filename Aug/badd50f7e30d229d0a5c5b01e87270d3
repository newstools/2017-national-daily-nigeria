In response to reactions towards its restricting customers from using their ATM cards for several transactions, UBA (United Bank of Africa) appears to have reversed itself.
In an email sent to by Chukwuma Nweke the bank’s Executive Director, Group COO, the bank apologized for the action and said customers can freely use their cards on any platform. The bank would however continue to monitor high risk websites to prevent unauthorized access to customer funds.
“We have listened to you and have heard that this is not in line with your expectations. We have immediately made adjustments accordingly. Please be informed that all sites have been unblocked and you can now transact on any platform globally that you would like to whilst we continue to provide surveillance on some high risk activity points to protect your transactions. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and will continue to work hard to serve you better.”
