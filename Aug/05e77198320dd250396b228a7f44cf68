Since Femi Adesina, a presidential media aide, has said no law compels President Muhammadu Buhari to hold the Federal Executive Council meeting weekly, Nigerians itching to assess the president’s fitness may have to wait longer before they see him.

Many have doubted the return of Buhari as proof of recovery after more than three months on medical leave in London.

It’s widely speculated the Resumeorresign protesters in London stampeded him to running back to Nigeria last Friday.

Adesina announced the cancellation of the meeting Wednesday, but gave no reason for the decision.

Buhari missed three of such meeting when his health took a dip between May and June, and was later flown back to London.

Asked about the decision in a telephone interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today, the presidential spokesman said there was nothing to it and that concerns about its implications were uncalled for.

“There is no law that says the Federal Executive Council meeting should hold every week. 

There is no law that says it must be weekly. Under a past administration, it used to hold once every two weeks,” he said.

“So, there is no law that says it should hold every Wednesday. It depends on what you have on the agenda to discuss. The President is the Chairman of that meeting. So, he has the discretion to hold or not to hold .”
