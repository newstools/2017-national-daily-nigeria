An Arabic teacher identified as Ibrahim Idris, has been dragged before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defiling three teenagers of the same parents.

The 23-year-old accused teacher resides at No. 2, Kelani Street Adealu Bus Stop in Dopemu, a Lagos suburb.

Idris is facing a charge of defilement for the offence of forcing three sisters of the same parents into an unholy sexual escapade.

The Prosecutor, Inspector Clifford Ogu, explained that the offence was committed between May and August, 2017 at the residence of the accused.

The minors whose age range between seven to 12 years, were said to be receiving Arabic and Islamic lessons from the accused when he used the opportunity to molest them sexually.

Ogu said, “The parents did not know that the accused was sexually molesting their daughters until they relocated to another area and needed to change their Arabic school.

“The smallest of the girl told the mother that they don’t want another uncle to be teaching them,” he added.

The mother became inquisitive and began to ask question before she was informed what the former teacher was doing to them.

As a result, the case was reported at the police station and the accused was subsequently arrested by the police.

National Daily learnt that the offence contravened Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.

The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge but the Chief Magistrate, Mrs Taiwo Akanni, admitted the accused to bail in the sum of N250, 000 with two sureties in like sum.

The case was later adjourned by Magistrate Akanni to September 11 for mention.
