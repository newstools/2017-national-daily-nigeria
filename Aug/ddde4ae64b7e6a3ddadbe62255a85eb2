Njodi reiterated that they will not chicken out despite the incident of July 25th 2017.

The NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said what happened was painful but said it is a sacrifice for the development of the country.

Njodo, therefore called on the NNPC to stand by the University and the families of the bereaved by providing the much-needed support to overcome the massive setback wrought by the insurgent attack.
Engr. Mohammed while responding said as a responsible corporate entity the NNPC would do everything within its means to support the University and the families of the victims of the attack.

“We have been great partners with the University of Maiduguri in tge past 12 years and certainly when losses like this happen and under this circumstance, we cannot abandon our partners to their fate,’’ Engr. Mohammed said.

The delegation also paid a condolence visit to the Theatre Command Headquarters of Operation Lafia Dole where a formal condolence letter from the HMSPR was handed over to Brig. Gen. Stevenson Olabanji who represented the theatre commander.

On his part, General Olabanji noted that the military would continue to carry out its statutory roles of providing security for exploration activities in the Chad Basin and beyond.
