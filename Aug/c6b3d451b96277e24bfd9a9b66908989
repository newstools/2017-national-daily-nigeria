She said that the albino group had been neglected for too long, hence they deserved to be given a sense of belonging.
 
“This kind gesture of the governor is to ameliorate the pains of these special people and prevent them from having skin cancer, sun burns and freckles usually caused by the scorching sun.
 
”We urge parents and guardians of albinos to bring them immediately for eye test at the agency’s office at the Ondo State Development and Property Corporation.”
 
According to her, “There is assurance that eye glasses and sun protection creams will be distributed when the eye test is completed.”
