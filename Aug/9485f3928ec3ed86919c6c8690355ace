A 23-year-old welder identified as Usman Abubakar, was on Monday convicted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment by a Mararaba Grade 1 Area Court at Aso Pada, Nasarawa State for stealing gari.


Before his conviction, Abubakar, was said to have been residing at Shopping Centre Mararaba.

National Daily gathered that he was sentenced on one-count  of theft by the judge, Mr Albert Maga, after he pleaded guilty to the crime and begged for leniency.

Abubakar, who felt sober explained that “hunger made me to steal the gari. I stayed
without food for days and I needed money to buy food.

“Please, have mercy on me and I promise never to do it again,” he pleaded.

Based on his remorse, the judge, however, gave the convict N5,000 option of fine.

National Daily learnt that the prosecutor, Agabi Auta, had explained to the court that one Anjenu John of Aku village, Mararaba, reported the matter at the ‘A’ Divisional Police Headquarters Mararaba on August 25.

Auta said, “The defendant went into the complainant’s shop located along Darika Jummat Mosque, Mararaba and stole a bag of garri valued at N15, 000.

He was in the process of taking the gari away when he was arrested and handed over to the police, an offence he was said to have confessed to during investigation.

He was duly convicted for the offence which was said to have contravened the provisions of Section 287 of the Penal Code.
