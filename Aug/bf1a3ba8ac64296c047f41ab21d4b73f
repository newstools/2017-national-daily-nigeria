The anger expressed towards media men was further demonstrated on Monday night when security personnel attached to Kogi state government house went on rampage and brutalized Channels TV reporter, Segun Salami.

After the beating, Salami was said to have been helped to the hospital in an undisclosed location by a good Samaritan and he is currently receiving treatment in Lokoja, the state capital.

Salami explained that trouble started for him old when one of the security personnel wrongly accused him of pointing at him while discussing with a female colleague with African Independent Television (AIT).

He further explained that every attempt made to deny that he was not referring to him fell on deaf ear as the security agent, aided by other security agents, descended on him.

He was dragged on the floor to the State House detention centre where he was locked up.

However, the State Commissioner of Police, Wilson Inalegwu, was said to be investigating the matter.

“We take the conduct of our personnel seriously and you can rest assured that no sinner will go unpunished,” he reiterated.
