As he spoke the Neymar deal was yet to go through but Wenger said: ‘It’s a consequence of ownership. It has changed the whole landscape of football over the last fifteen years.
‘Once countries own football clubs everything is possible and it has become very difficult to respect Financial Fair Play.’
The deal is being funded by PSG owner, Nasser Al-Khelafi and his Qatar sports investment firm.
