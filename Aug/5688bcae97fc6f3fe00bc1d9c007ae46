The south-east governors have told IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu that confrontation is not the way go about his agitation for a state of Biafra.

The Igbo governor met with Kanu in Enugu on Wednesday and told him his demands must not be absolute.

The two-and-a-half-hour meeting also resolved to engage the entire leadership of IPOB in further dialogue to address their demands.

Kanu arrived Enugu Government House around 1.30 p.m. in the company of a constitutional lawyer, Ben Nwabueze, who is also the leader of Igbo Leaders of Thought, 
ILT, and Eliot Uko, deputy secretary of ILT.
