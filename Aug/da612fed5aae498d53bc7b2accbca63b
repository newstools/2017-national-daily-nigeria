However, Counsel to the respondents, Mr. Eze, on Tuesday August 15, argued before Justice Anka that the suit should not be heard because the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Idris and the Lagos state Police Commissioner, Mr. Owho have not been personally served with the court processes.
But Evans’ lawyer countered by saying that the law, under Order 5 Rule 2 of the Fundamental Rights Enforcement Procedure Rules of 2009, allows him to serve the agents of the respondent. 
But Justice Anka adjourned ruling on the case till August 16 after listening to the submissions of counsel to Evans, Olukoya Ogungbeje and that of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad and the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Emmanuel Eze.
