Reacting, Managing director, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr David Adnori said, “The federal government has debt in naira and foreign exchange.
“The government has over borrowed. If you look at debt services obligations, compared to the budget, it is on a high side which makes it dangerous. If anything happens and government unable to service its debt, it will affect the credit worthiness of the country,” he said. 
In his comment, the head, Research and Strategy at GTI Securities Limited, Mr Chucks Anyanwu, noted that government’s borrowing has been a mixture of short- term and long-term from international investors.
He expressed that CBN did not break the debt services/payment into different categories.
According to him, the government borrowing depends on utilisations and timely interventions.
In addition, managing director, Enterprise Stockbrokers Plc, Rotimi Fakayejo, said the CBN’s debt service could have been utilised effectively in the real sector of economy, appealing to government to reduce its borrowing and concentrate more on generating initial revenue using the tax.
He stated that the federal government should strengthen its nationwide tax collection policy by linking of Biometric Verification Number of working class citizens to a centralised tax payment.
