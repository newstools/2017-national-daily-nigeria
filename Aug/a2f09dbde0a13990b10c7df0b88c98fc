Some Nigerian youths have stormed Abuja in protest of the long absence of President Muhammadu Buhari from the country.
The protesters, led by maverick Area Fada, Charles Oputa, otherwise known as Charly Boy, are calling on the president to either return to the country, resume office or resign.

They are currently at the Unity Fountain and are marching to the National Assembly singing solidarity song.
President Buhari has been on medical vacation to London, the United Kingdom, since May 7, 2017. Though, the President in a letter to the Senate had mandated Professor Yemi Osinbajo  to be acting in his absence, his absence, however, created leadership vacuum since there were reports that Acting President had to secure permission from Buhari before major executive decisions are made.
