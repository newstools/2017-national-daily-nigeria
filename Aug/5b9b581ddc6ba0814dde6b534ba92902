South West leaders met in Lagos on Sunday and have agreed on September 7 as the day to organise their upcoming Yoruba “Grand Rally on Restructuring”.

The Chairman, Organising Committee for the rally, Dr. Kunle Olajide, announced the development when he addressed newsmen on Sunday






Olajide said the rally, scheduled to hold in Ibadan, Oyo State on September 7, would be a one-agenda-congress on restructuring.
He said: “This endeavour has to do with Nigeria and the aim is for a united Nigeria.
“The all-inclusive summit of the Yoruba people will have more than 100 Yoruba groups that will declare their stand on the need to restructure Nigeria.

“Yoruba leaders at home and abroad and organised groups, students, artisans, past and current elected public officials across the political spectrum will be converging in Ibadan to appraise the issue of restructuring and fashion out a workable way out of the quagmire the country is presently in.”
The meeting, which held at the Protea Hotel, Ikeja, saw key leaders from the zone such as Pa Reuben Fasoranti, Chief Ayo Adebanjo and Chief Amos Akingba in attendance.
Also at the meeting were Chief Supo Sonibare (Afenifere Chairman, Lagos), Yinka Odumakin (Afenifere Spokesman), and Prof. Banji Akintoye, among many others.
Olajide said although the South West governors and all Yoruba would be at the meeting, the gathering would be a non-political one.
