A housewife in Akure on Wednesday consented to her husband’s application for divorce, saying she welcomed the freedom from the union with a sex-maniac of a husband.

Adaramola Esther, who was testifying before an Akure Customary Court in a divorce suit filed by her husband Michael Adaramola accused her man crazy love-making mostly enhanced by aphrodisiacs.
 
According to her, the husband normally transfers his anger to their three children whenever they had disagreement.

 “One of the causes of the problems is that my husband uses manpower before making love to me, which is not pleasing to me.

“He also wants me to exhibit different sexual styles which are odd and unacceptable to me. I have told him that I cannot continue with vigorous sexual intercourse,” she said.

The respondent showed the court a piece of the drug as exhibit, and added that she would not contest the application for divorce.

“It will actually give me peace of mind,’’ she said.

 “Her extra-marital inclination has become a recurring decimal, keeping late nights after work,’’ he said.
