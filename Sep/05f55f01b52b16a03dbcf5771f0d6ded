The Senate has  passed a bill criminalising abduction, wrongful restraint or confinement for ransom, and anyone found guilty will be sentence to death.

A 30-year jail term awaits anybody that colludes with an abductor.

The bill sponsored by Isa Misau, APC-Bauchi, was passed into law Thursday after a consideration of the report by Senate committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.

Presenting the report, Chukwuka Utazi, Enugu-North, said the bill sought to combat and prevent any form of kidnapping in Nigeria by giving wider powers to the Inspector-General of Police to ensure adequate policing of the crime.

“Whoever is guilty of the offence and then results in the death of the victim shall be liable on conviction to be sentenced to death,” its  Clause 1 (3) states.

The report was unanimously accepted by the lawmakers after a voice vote.

Lagos was the first place to sign into law a capital punishment for man-snatching.
