An Abia State Chief Magistrate Court sitting in Umuahia,  has remanded 60 members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) at the Afara Federal Prisons in Aba, National Daily reports.
The magistrate ordered that the I​POB members be remanded in prison after their counsel challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter.
The magistrate, who had directed that the case file be transferred to the Department for Public Prosecution (DPP) for advice, later adjourned the case till October 25.
