The University of Benin has announced 28th September to 10th October, 2017 as the new dates for its post-UTME.

The test would hold at the Ugbowo Campus in Benin City. Prospective candidates are expected to check the university website: www.uniben.edu for their new date, venue and
time for their test as from Monday, 25th September, 2017.

A statement signed by the Registrar of the University, Mrs O.A Oshodin and made available to National Daily said “The post UTME screening exercise of UNIBEN earlier scheduled for 14th to 25th September, 2017 has been rescheduled for 28th September to 10th October, 2017 in designated centres within the Ugbowo campus of the University.”

While reminding the candidates that the exam is Computer Based Test (CBT) mode, she added that only candidates who applied through JAMB in the 2017/2018 UTME admission into UNIBEN as first choice and scored 200 and above are eligible for the screening exercise.

National Daily recalls that the test had earlier been suspended following the strike embarked upon by the nonacademic staff Unions nationwide which was called off last Thursday.
