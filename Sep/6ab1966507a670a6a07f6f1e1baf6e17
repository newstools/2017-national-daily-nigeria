The Reformed Niger Delta Avengers, RNDA, in coalition with nine other militant groups, last night restated their two-week ultimatum to the Federal government to open talks with the Pan Niger Delta People’s Congress (PNDPC) or risk another major crisis in the region.
In the statement released by the group and made available to National Daily, the group said it was too early for Nigerians to celebrate the Federal Government’s claim that the nation had come out of recession, as militants would resume attacks that will further deepen the nation’s woes if urgent steps were not taken.
 “Nigerians should not celebrate the Federal Government’s claim that the nation had come out recession because it is too early as RNDA in coalition with other militant groups is ready to resume fresh attacks on oil installations across the region in a well-coordinated attack that will further deepen the nation’s economic woes,” Leader of RNDA and Convener of the coalition of militants, self –styled “Major General” John Mark Ezonbi, said in the statement.
The militants also warned: “The Federal Government should not take the two week ultimatum that is still counting, which we earlier issued to convey a fresh talk with the Pan Niger Delta People’s Congress, PNDPC, headed by the paramount ruler of Seimbiri Kingdom, HM Pere Charles Ayemi Botu for granted and should blame itself for any harm done to oil facilities in the Niger Delta at the expiration of the ultimatum.”
Ezonbi asserted: “RNDA in coalition with nine other militant groups, led by Major General John Mark Ezonbi at a crucial meeting held at the creeks of Benin River expressed its readiness to carry out its threat to bring down crude oil productions to zero level, which accompanied its ultimatum to the Federal Government.”

RNDA and others stated: “PNDPC has been given the mandate to discuss and dialogue on behalf of the Niger Delta region with the Federal Government because of the credible persons drawn from all parts of the region, no other group such as PANDEF is recognized to meet with the Federal Government.
The militants noted “that the federal government has put deliberate policies to kill the economy of the Niger Delta as nothing meaningful is happening , while they continue to use our oil wealth to develop other areas, particularly the north,” warning, “we cannot continue to sit down and watch, we must act and the time to act is now.”
They also announced the lifting of the suspension placed on former Federal Commissioner for Information and leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, Chief Edwin Clark, “following pleas and persuasion from well-respected traditional rulers and stakeholders of the region.”
