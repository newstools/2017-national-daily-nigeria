Manchester United striker, Romelu Lukaku, has opened up saying his goal celebration which involved holding his ear to Everton fans, after scoring in their 4-0 win, was just “banter”.

A late drama saw United defeat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday.


Lukaku first set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan for their second goal, then netted from close range himself, before Anthony Martial wrapped things up from the penalty spot.

Lukaku cupped his ear in celebration after his 89th minute strike, which could have been perceived as goading Everton fans, though he insisted that was not the case.

“I mean, it’s another goal and I’m happy with the win,” he told Sky Sports.

“It [the celebration] was just a bit of banter, after [they cheered] the free-kick I missed.”


Lukaku also admitted that United was not clinical enough in the game, as they should have wrapped up victory earlier.

“We could have scored more in first half,” he added.

“We weren’t clinical enough.

“Everton created problems in midfield and the manager gave us tips at half-time of how to sort it.


“In the second half, Everton had a lot of control but quality was the difference in the end.”
