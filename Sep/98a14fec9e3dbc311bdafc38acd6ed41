It has now been uncovered by National Daily after thorough investigation on series of tricks employed by notorious kidnappers why security agencies find it always difficult to arrest the major suspects after investigating major cases of kidnapping across the country.

A recent investigation carried out by National Daily reveals how majority of the kidnap kingpins now capitalize on the poor state of the economy to use their ill gotten wealth to lure young male and females who move round the streets and cities across the country marketing SIM cards of the various mobile communication companies.

It was gathered that the competition in the sales of the lines this open the door for the kidnappers to lure the sales representatives to even go as far as using their own pictures and addresses some time fake to register as many lines as possible which will now be used to carry on with their illegal kidnap trade across the land.

This National Daily learnt that has been the case for many years now which make it impossible for Police operatives to find it hard to arrest the real suspects even after using their information technology gadgets to track the lines used by the kidnappers either to call the family of their victims and other contacts being made while the victim last in captivity in the kidnap den.

Investigation carried out so far by National Daily revealed that no fewer than 23 mobile phone line dealers are now in Police cell across three state Police commands over their involvement in registering phone lines which they used their own identity only to be operated by unknown persons who were involved in various cases of kidnapping.

The states the incident occurred include Lagos where 12 persons are now being interrogated at the State Anti Robbery Squad over registering of SIM with their own identity but being used by kidnappers.

One of such case has been linked to the ongoing – celebrated case of Evans the notorious kidnapper who was recently arraigned at the Ikeja High Court alongside others over his role in series of kidnapping, Robbery, murder and other heinous crimes him and his gang committed during his many years of reign in the crime world.

Other states include Delta state Police command, who recently paraded eight suspects involved in the same act of helping kidnappers to register their phone lines, the other state is Akwa-Ibom where three suspects were arrested last week for similar offence. 

National Daily, learnt that this exposure will shock even the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) to begin fresh look into how to sanitize the communication industry looking at the crime rate in the country and how the industry is being invaded by criminals who are capitalizing on the ongoing hardship with low standard of living in the country. 

When contacted the Force Public Relations Officer, Yekini Jimoh, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) said Police will investigate the cases and sanitize the country.
