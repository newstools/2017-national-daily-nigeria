Residents and traders in Jos metropolis scampered for safety on Thursday evening as the Hausa took to the streets to attack people.

Although the reason for the panic is yet unknown as at press time, but sources say it is connected to the current face off between soldiers and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Aba, Abia State.

One of the traders who spoke with the reporter said, security operatives just came and ask us to close our shops, before I knew what was happening, people began to park their goods and locked up their shops.




Our correspondent gathered that four major markets in Jos metropolis were already deserted as at 5:51pm.

However, The Special Task Force (STF), Media Officer, Captain Umar Adams said the panic was ignited by rumour mongers who are bent on putting fear in the mind of people.

He said that the STF is fully deployed to the affected area and normalcy will soon return.

Meanwhile, another trader who escaped from one of the market said, “Hausa boys chased her with cutlass, adding that she was only lucky to have escaped.

“Immediately I locked my shop, I saw some group of Hausa boys coming with cutlasses after me. I ran like I have never done in my whole life because I saw death before me,”  she added.
