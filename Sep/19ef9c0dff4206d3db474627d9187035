Felix Anyansi Agwu believes his players fully deserve to qualify for continental football following the draw in Enugu.
Having been fourth on the table for weeks, Enyimba needed a point against Rangers to move into third, albeit with Akwa United suffering a defeat of their own in Ibadan, and that worked out just right for The Elephants.
Had the Flying Antelopes not been awarded a late and quite frankly a bizarre penalty, Enyimba would have won and ultimately done the unimaginable, qualify for the 2018 CAF Champions League playing outside Aba the entire season.
Regardless, Anyansi Agwu says his club are fully deserving of their position on the table: “Yes, we merit a continental ticket because we have worked very hard this season,” he told National Daily “We fully deserve to represent Nigeria on the continent given our performances this season.”
“Our position on the table is not because we played well against Rangers, no. It’s because we have worked extremely hard since the start of the season. It is why we are where we are today. We could have been talking about a second place finish, but now we are in third and will finish the season in third, with the full committment of the team National Daily gathered.
“Everybody has been focused this season, focused and determined and we are benefitting from it. Despite playing in Calabar, the team has shown a strong will and here we are, in third place with one match to go.”
Felix Anyansi Agwu has been an inspirational leader for Enyimba, the driving force, the calm and steady hand steering the club forward. Another qualification to compete in Africa after what has been an arduous campaign will certainly reinforce his colossal reputation as the greatest ever club football administrator in Nigeria.
