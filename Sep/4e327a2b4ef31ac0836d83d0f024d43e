Ogun, Osun are among some 13 states still heavily indebted to primary school teachers in payment of months of arrears.
The Acting Secretary-General of the Nigeria Union of Teachers, NUT, Mike Ike-Ene, disclosed this on Tuesday in Abuja adding that initially, 19 States owed, but some states have paid except the 13.
According to him, other states owing are Imo, Oyo, Abia, Kogi, Benue, Zamfara, Taraba, Plateau, Benue and Bayelsa states, among others.
Ike-Ene, explained that the union expected the affected states to use the window of the long vacation to pay these teachers, but only few states like Anambra and Akwa-Ibom states among others complied.
He commended those states that ensured that the welfare of the teachers were paramount and also encouraged others to do same.
“It may interest you to know that few weeks back at Ibadan, we re-appraised the way our teachers are being owed; about 19 states visibly owed our teachers various forms of money.
“Ranging from salaries to gratuity for many months; some two months to one year and about 28 states are paying salaries in percentages.
“We requested government to use the window of the long vacation to pay these teachers.
“But it might surprise you to know that states like Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Kano and Rivers collected N10 billion Paris Club fund each including others. Yet some of the states could not use this money to offset the teachers’ outstanding salary arrears,’’ he said.
Ike-Ene commended the teachers for their perseverance urging them to continue to do their best.
“I just want to use this medium to thank all our teachers in primary and secondary schools throughout the period and further encourage them to do continue to do their best .’’
He also appealed to the government to pay the outstanding salary arrears, saying that if every effort to settle peacefully fails the union would have no option than embark on industrial action.
