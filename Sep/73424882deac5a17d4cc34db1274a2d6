A 24-year-old man, Oribamise Jimoh, on Wednesday appeared in an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly defiling an 8-year-old daughter of his neighbour.
Jimoh who resides at No 9, Owonikoko Street, Ayobo, Lagos, is facing a two count charge of defilement and breach of peace.
The Prosecutor, Insp. Clifford Ogu, said that the offence was committed on Sept. 16 in the apartment of the accused.
Ogu told the court that the accused lured the minor into his room on the pretext of sending her on an errand and defiled her.
“The accused defiled the girl in his room, gave her N30 and told her not to tell anyone and that if she did, she would die.

“The girl walked strangely and her mother’s sister who noticed it called the mother’s attention to it. “The girl narrated everything that the accused did to her,” the prosecutor said.
He said the offence contravened Section 137 and 166 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the section prescribes life imprisonment for offenders.
The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.
The Chief Magistrate, Taiwo Akanni, granted bail to the accused in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum each and adjourned the case until Oct. 10 for mention.
