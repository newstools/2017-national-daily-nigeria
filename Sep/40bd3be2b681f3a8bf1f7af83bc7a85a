After two hours of executive session on Tuesday, the Senate has re-affirmed its stand on national unity, saying all forms of agitation must comply with the provisions of the law.
Reacting officially to the skirmishes between the now proscribed IPOB and the Nigeria military operations in the South East, Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki said: “We discussed on National unity and resolved that all agitations must be in line with the provisions of law. Is it a true reflection of what happened?, he said.
Official position of the Senate was also in line with that of Caucaus meeting of the Federal lawmakers from the South East zone headed by Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe representing Abia North Senatorial district.

The position was, however, silent on the legalities or otherwise of the prescription of IPOB and ‘terrorist status’ of the organisation given the fact that the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, in a press statement which he personally signed differed on the position by the Federal government.
Though, tongues wagged over Saraki’s position as some lawmakers allegedly threatened to take on him when the upper chamber reconvenes this Tuesday, the discussion was however smooth.
In his address, the Senate reminded lawmakers that there were daunting challenges confronting the nation. He urged them to be united in order to move the nation forward.
