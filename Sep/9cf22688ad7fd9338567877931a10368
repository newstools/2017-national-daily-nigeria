A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Friday sentenced a 34-year-old ex-convict , Friday Glory, to eighteen​ months imprisonment for being in possession of a stolen motorcycle.
The convict, of no fixed address, was convicted on a two-count charge of possessing property reasonable suspected to be stolen and for being an incorrigible vagabond.
Glory had pleaded guilty to the charge, saying he.acted out of ignorance and urged the court to temper justice with mercy.
He also promised to be of good behaviour and get a decent job.
The judge, Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq, however, did not give the convict any option of fine and said the sentence was to serve as deterrent to other habitual offenders.
