Neymar has reportedly demanded the sale of team-mate and forward partner Edinson Cavani.

According to Spanish publication, Neymar has made his feelings abundantly clear to those in charge of the club.

He views the on-pitch relationship with the Uruguayan as ‘impossible’ following their penalty dispute and dressing-room bust-up in the aftermath of the 2-0 victory against Lyon on Sunday.

Neymar’s compatriot Dani Alves was also involved, while reports elsewhere claimed another Brazilian, captain Thiago Silva, was forced to separate the feuding pair in the dressing room after the game which saw Unai Emery’s men maintain a three-point lead at the head of Ligue 1.

Despite their success on the pitch, Catalan-based outlet Sport claims that Neymar is furious with the Uruguayan and believes he has attempted to undermine the superstar status he was guaranteed by Al-Khelaifi upon completing his world record move from Barcelona.

ESport also claims the 25-year-old has the support of the Brazilian enclave at PSG, which also includes the likes of Marquinhos and Lucas Moura, and has also garnered the backing of fellow new signing Kylian Mbappe.
