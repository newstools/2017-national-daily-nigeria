Ex-vice president of Nigeria under Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration, Atiku Abubakar, took to his Twitter page to boast about creating no less than 50,000 direct jobs.
He also claimed that Nigerians are the country’s biggest asset and not the oil sector.
He tweeted: “By the grace of God, I have created 50,000 direct jobs, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of indirect jobs because I believed that oil is not Nigerians biggest asset, Nigerians are.”
