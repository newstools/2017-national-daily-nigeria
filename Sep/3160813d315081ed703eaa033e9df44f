A young mother named Dru Wheeler who battled through the floodwaters of Hurricane Harvey to give birth has named her baby Noah Harvey.

She has named him after the devastating storm.

Her dentist husband Kallen called 911 but there were no ambulances available so the hospital sent a high clearance truck with a paramedic to collect her.


Healthy Noah Harvey was born weighing eight pounds and ten ounces, moments before Beaumont Baptist Hospital had to be evacuated.



Dru boarded the vehicle but Kellen and their two-year-old Jonas couldn’t fit. After moving their valuables above the water line, the father and son tried to get to the hospital in their SUV but waterlogged the engine broke down.

A Good Samaritan who saw them walking picked them up and took them to the hospital – but they narrowly missed the arrival of their latest family member.

Delighted Kallen told Deseret News “Dru’s contractions began even as the flood waters in our home were just starting to rise'”.

‘I consider us to be pretty blessed and I was ecstatic to be a part of that experience.’

Dru, who like her husband is a Mormon, added: ‘When we saw the water coming in it was a shock, so we said a quick prayer. The nurses at the hospital were awesome.’
