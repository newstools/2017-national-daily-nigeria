Militants operating under the canopy of Coalition of Niger Delta Agitators while threatening to resume attack on oil facilities by September 10, said it has not withdrawn the threat issued to Yoruba and Hausa people to vacate the region.
The group in a statement claimed that its intelligence department has a list which showed that northerners have over 90 per cent of the oil wells and the Yoruba have about seven per cent, while the Igbo have about two per cent while the Niger Delta people do not have up to one per cent of the oil wells.
“We are not talking only about the notice to quit; we are also talking about the Niger Delta Republic. We have seen that the Federal Government is not serious about the Niger Delta issue.”

“This has never happened in the case of the Niger Delta; the Federal Government has never inaugurated a committee to handle the Niger Delta issue. The only language the Federal Government seems to understand is violence. September 10 is the day we will resume attacks (on oil installations). By September 10, which is on Sunday, over 5,000 members of the Niger Delta Coalition of Agitators will shut down no less than over 20 platforms.
“We have not given anybody any mandate to withdraw the notice to quit we issued. On the group (PNDPC) talked about, we have said we are not working with this set of old people again. The composition of that group is not different from that of PANDEF.
“Already, we are talking with leaders of ethnic nationalities and if at the end, we reach a conclusion, we will make it public. Nobody will withdraw the notice on our behalf – we will do that. The fact is that those that announced the withdrawal of the notice are not the ones that issued it. We don’t know them.”
