Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, on Wednesday, called on the Federal Government to investigate alleged attacks on Hausa community in Rivers State by suspected IPOB members on Tuesday evening.
“The Federal Government should quickly investigate the violent attacks on Hausa community in Rivers and ensure that those behind it are not only punished but also sanctioned to serve as deterrent,” the governor had said during a visit to his office by leaders of the Northern Youth Coalition.
Ganduje warned that a failure to punish those behind the attacks will ensure that the case continues to recur, and “possibly lead to something else.”

He commended the restraint by the Northern youth.
“This disposition of the Northern Youth shows that they stand by one united Nigeria devoid of rancor and instability, and this should be commended and also be emulated,’’ the governor said.
The Kano governor also commended Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State for his quick intervention. He also lauded the military for efforts to tackle the uprising.
