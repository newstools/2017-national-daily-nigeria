Ekiti Governor Ayodele Fayose has officially declared his intention to contest the 2019
presidential election under the Peoples Democratic Party.

His declaration took place at the Chelsea Hotel, Abuja on Thursday.

Although the party told him Wednesday the ticket has been zoned to the north, he went ahead to make the declaration as planned.

Fayose is the only contender from the southwest, and he might be heading for a war with the PDP just trying to find its footing after it lost out in the 2015 presidential election.

While he remains the loudest of the opposition elements in the southwest, and many applaud him for his constant criticism of President Muhammadu Buhari, it is unlikely he will have support in the south-south, southeast, and the northern part of the country.
