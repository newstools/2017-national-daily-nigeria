“Hello, Imagine you are from Cameroon.
Well it’s a bad time to be a Cameroonian. You don’t want to imagine. So thank God you are a Nigerian. Days like this gives hope” a happy Nigerian tweets after Super Eagles picked up a point from Yaounde, Cameroon.

Team Nigeria was able to pick 4 points from the two legs of the world cup qualifier matches, that was played this past Fridayand Monday. They did that scoring 5 goals, 4 in Uyo, 1 in Yaounde.

“Leon Balogun should be running for Defense Minister. Why not? He knows when to attack, which weapon to use, who to stop and how to stop such”, the Nigerian player, who does business for Mainz FC in Germany was at his best.

Moses, two of them, of Simon and Victor, must have done their internship with the Biblical Moses. They have mastered the act of dividing strong elements. What Moses did to the red sea, they do to the iron-bodied Cameroon team.

On this day, even the weakest legs of our team, Echejile and Onazi are yet superb.

Mikel reminds all of us that being 2nd best to Messi few years ago at the Junior Boys world cup wasn’t a fluke. He shows us why he was a Chelsea player for 10years.

Odion  Ighalo and the rest of the lads were pretty much on point.

Well, we could have had it done and dusted. If the Cameroonians didn’t force a draw.

Ezenwa, the goalie, was quite some awesome hero. He was brave and ready!

What could we have done better? Any solution to Echejile and Onazi would have been better. Unfortunately there’s no Onazi 2.0 or Echejile 1.0.

However, if at the 70th minute, we  brought in Agu (not to replace Mikel) to play Ndidi’s role. And instruct Ndidi to take up Onazi’s role. I believe things will be finer. However, you want to keep experiments low, so I understand Rohr’s decision.

The decision to take off Mikel Obi for Agu was based on the history that produced a goal made by Onazi and Iheanchor connect. They thought if Mikel is pulled off, Onazi will be free to test that understanding with Iheanchor. But while they were hashing that idea, HHello, Imagine you are from Cameroon.

But just as they play with such thought, Hugo Broos was busy discovering the solution  to his problem: it would be difficult to pass through Ekong and Balogun. But easier to go through Echejile. So he quickly made substitution towards activating the new plan. And that brought pressure to the back left.

We had to settle for a point. Not too bad, not bad at all. 4 points from both legs. Cool.
