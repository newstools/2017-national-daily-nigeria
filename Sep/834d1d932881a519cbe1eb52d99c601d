At least two persons have been arrested in connection to last weekend attack on a Hausa Market in Asaba.

Armed men suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) that left four indigenes of Hausa death and several others with various degrees of wounds on Friday.

At about 11 pm on Friday, over 20 armed members of IPOB invaded our mosque at cable point and threw an explosive into the mosque, but unfortunately it did not explode. According to reports, the worshipers raised the alarm, and the attackers moved straight to the Hausa market also called Abraka Market where they killed four.

The suspects arrested are Abraham Ndudi, 24, from Kwale, and Okereke Ifeanyi, 21, Ogbaru in Anambra.

“The suspects were arrested from their hiding place on the ceiling of a major hotel in Abraka, Asaba, where they had fled into in their dire bid to escape arrest and are already helping the police in their investigation, efforts are on top gear to arrest the third suspect, whose real name is yet unknown but simply identified as “Last Burial”,” Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) DSP Andrew Aniamaka said in a statement.  

The police said investigation has commenced on the incident, and the intention of the killers and their collaborators will soon be revealed.

The command called on non-indigenes and indigenes alike to not panic or contemplate any reprisal action as the law will surely take its course.

State Commissioner of Police Zanna Ibrahim has fixed a meeting between the leadership of non-indigenes and other key actors in the state over the unfortunate incident by 4 pm today at the Police Officers Mess, Okwe, Asaba, the state capital.
