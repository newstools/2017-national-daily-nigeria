The management of Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH) has summoned a graduate of the College, Quadri Adewale Fasasi, from the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) following accusations of an alleged involvement in examinations fraud, National Daily reports.
Fasasi was said to have been wrongly cleared for national service by the College and based on a petition, the management wrote to the Director General of NYSC, Abuja, demanding for the his recall, he has now been withdrawn.
The letter dated July 19, 2017 and signed by Deputy Registrar, Mrs. T.A. Obadimu, reads in part: “Mr. Fasasi has a pending academic case in the college. He was wrongly listed on the graduand list for 2014/2015 academic year.”
Fasasi, a Higher Diploma student in Accountancy department with matriculation F/HD/12/3610016 with call-up letter number NYSC/YCT 10016/373713, was involved in exam malpractice with another student.

It was gathered that Fasasi, also a staff of the College and the other student, had faced the Students Investigations Exam Committee and were found guilty.
The panel then recommended that both should repeat HND II.
“Rather than repeat HND II, he (Fasasi) used his connection as a staff and got cleared for NYSC to Ondo State.
A source in the school told National Daily that the other student found out and petitioned the management thus prompting the recall of Fasasi from NYSC
