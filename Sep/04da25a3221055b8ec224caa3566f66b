Banking system liquidity shortfall which hit 59 billion naira on Wednesday was expected to widen to more than 100 billion as the CBN sold 207 billion naira in treasuries on Thursday to mop up liquidity, a day after it raised more money than planned via a debt auction as it moved to keep borrowing costs high to support the currency, traders said.
National Daily gathered from experts that there is pushing up costs, especially for the government, which is battling to contain a widening deficit.
Rate-setter Doyin Salami said central bank investments in government treasury bills had risen 30 percent to 454 billion naira since December, leaving the bank providing “piggy bank” services to the state.
The CBN sold six-bill open market bills (OMO) at 17.95 percent, higher than the 16.8 percent it paid to place the same maturity at the auction on Wednesday.
Overnight rates had started to inch up, traders said. Money market rates opened at 11 percent on Thursday after they hovered between nine and 10 percent the previous day.
