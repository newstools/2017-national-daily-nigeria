“The protection of lives and property of the citizenry, enforcement of all laws and regulations and prevention of crimes lie squarely on police shoulders”, he said.
“The police cannot afford to disappoint the populace by allowing crime and criminality to thrive in the country. You must therefore put in your utmost best to maintain law and order at all times.”
Niger Deputy governor, Mohammad Ketso who represented Governor Sani Bello challenged the police force to “look inwards and think of how to confront the new forms of crimes and criminality that pervades our society”.
Ketso congratulated the new policemen and urged them to serve with “due determination and dedication to service so that you can contribute your quota to the peace efforts of the government.”
