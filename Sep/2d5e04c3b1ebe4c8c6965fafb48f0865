Real Madrid forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has responded to his critics and expressed surprise that he continually has to prove himself to the fans.

Ronaldo silenced his critics after stepping up again with a double for the Blancos.

The Portuguese scored twice to help Madrid secure a 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The 32-year-old’s domestic return has not gone as planned as he is unable to net in two La Liga games since retun from suspension.

But the Portugal captain said he is getting tired of the constant criticism as he had already proven himself.

He told Atresmedia after netting his 400th goal for Madrid, “It seems that I have to keep showing exactly who I am in every match.

“I am surprised by what the public thinks of me, my numbers speak for themselves, I am an exemplary professional and I always have a clear mind.
“The criticism is getting worse.”

Ronaldo said the team stepped up which led to the winning at Dortmund for the first time.

He added, “Before the game we spoke about how much we wanted to win in Dortmund.

“We did what the coach told us, the team has been phenomenal, creating opportunities and it isn’t easy to score three goals here.

“We played well.”
