As a result of IPOB agitations and legal struggles over the unity of Nigeria, the House of Representatives has decided to revisit the devolution of power bill which failed during the 
constitutional amendment in June.

Leader of the House Femi Gbajabiamila raised this in a matter of urgent public importance on Tuesday.

According to him, different agitations across the country have led to divergent views on the structures upon which the unity of Nigeria rests.

“These agitations have resulted into proscription of groups, loss of lives and judicial pronouncements,” Gbajabiamila said.

“Events of the last few weeks brought Nigeria close to the precipice but for the determination of Nigerians in their various show of commitment to the peace and unity of the country. Hence the urgent need for the intervention of the House of Representatives,” the lawmaker ‎said.

part from revisiting devolution of powers bill, the House will also be setting up a strong committee to liaise with stakeholders across the six geopolitical zones for practical solutions to issues threatening Nigeria’s unity.

The separatist group has been designated a terrorist organisation, and its leader Nnamdi Kanu has been declared wanted by the security agencies.

Kanu has however challenged the government decision in court through his lawyer.
