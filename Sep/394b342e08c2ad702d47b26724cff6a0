Utsev had bemoaned that since 2013, Benue State had not received any ecological assistance from the Federal Government, adding that many disasters may be mitigated if adequate budgetary provisions were made.
The Commissioner said that dredging the River Benue would provide permanent solution to the recurring flood in the state.
“Benue Government is looking for ways in which River Benue can be dredged; this is because by dredging the river, majority of the water can be accommodated and thus, prevent future overflow,” he said.
“The ongoing research so far, shows that the preliminary study would cost about N8 billion while the main project would gulp about N300 billion.
“And this is where we need Federal Government financial intervention to execute the project, since the funds are much.”
