At the end of its 258th meeting (fifth this year), the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to maintain status quo for the seventh consecutive session by retaining the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 14.0%; Asymmetric corridor around the MPR at +200/-500bps; Cash Reserves Ratio (CRR) at 22.5%; and Liquidity Ratio (LR) at 30.0%. 

The MPC members were faced with the choices of maintaining status quo, tightening, or easing monetary policy. Amid strong arguments for the three positions, the choice to support growth without jeopardizing recent gains around prices (particularly exchange rate) culminated into a decision (6 votes to 1) of holding policy rates constant, while allowing for policy flexibility as developments unfold in the macroeconomic space.

With the MPC highlighting that inflation expectation remains anchored on the strength of tight monetary policy — and (6) relative improvement in the forex space, amid continued healthy accretion to the nation’s foreign reserves, and heralding stability of the average naira exchange rate across various segments of the market. Again, the risk facing the domestic economy remains in two folds (i.e. price and output), with complementary fiscal and monetary policy remaining crucial to continued growth.
