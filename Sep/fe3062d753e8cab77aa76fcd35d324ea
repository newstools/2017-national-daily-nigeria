Reports indicate thousands of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), members loaded themselves in tippers, buses and other cars from different South-East states heading to the home of their leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, in Umuhia, Abia State, to protest  the siege of the Nigerian army in the zone. The exodus of the Igbo youths into Abia started after Soldiers were seen with armoured tankers in front of Kanu’s home. The information was spreading on the social media like wild fire.
The mounting tension precipitated the declaration of three days curfew by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to douse the tension.
