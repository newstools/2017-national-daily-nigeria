The United Labour Congress of Nigeria (ULC), upon the expiration of the previous 14-Day ultimatum issued the Federal Government to accede to the demands of Nigerian workers and masses, has issued a 7-Days final strike notice that will herald the commencement of the proposed strike without further warnings, come Friday 15th Day of September.
ULC’s President Comrade Joe Ajaero made the assertion following the seemingly insensitive stance of the Federal Government to the plights of the teeming workers,threatening a total halt of the nation’s economy if government fails to consider the terms expressly communicated to it.
According to Ajaero while reeling out the communique of the Emergency National Administrative Committee(NAC) meeting jointly held with the National Strike Committee of the ULC yesterday at at the union’s headquarters in Yaba,the Federal Government previous response to ULC’s letters largely failed to adequately address the critical issues raised in our demands.
“Appropriate organ of the Congress views the response as grossly inadequate in assuaging the fears which drove the decision of the CWC to issue the ultimatum rejected it outright,in lieu of this rejection,it ordered an immediate issuance of a 7-Days final strike notice to the federal government,which has already been done and will expire on Friday 15th Day of September.
“If the federal Government refused to accommodate these demands we shall be compelled to embark on the proposed strike without further warnings.

It would be recalled that the ULC has earlier stated their demands to which the federal government refused to give consideration
These includes; the halt of continued militarization of workplaces and factory premises,prompt conformity with international best labour practices,immediate review of the Privatisation of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN).
