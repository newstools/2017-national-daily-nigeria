The market had opened for the week on a negative note on Monday as investors await the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria. At the end of the meeting in Abuja, the MPC left all left all key rates unchanged, while the stock market posted a higher decline.
Specifically, the NSE ASI fell by 1.15 per cent to close at 34,951.27, compared with a depreciation of 0.37 per cent the previous day. The depreciation recorded in the share prices of Dangote Cement, Nestle, Nigerian Breweries, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa was mainly responsible for the negative close recorded in the index.
