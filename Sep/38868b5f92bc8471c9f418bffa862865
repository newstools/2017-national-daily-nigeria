A huge python that swallowed an antelope in Ile-Oluji area of Ondo state was captured, killed and butchered by residents for food recently.
National Daily learned that the python had freshly swallowed the antelope and couldn’t move as digestion for snakes is usually slow and Energy draining, so some residents took advantage of the situation to kill the huge reptile.
