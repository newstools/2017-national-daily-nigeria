Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau State, has challenged anybody that has verifiable evidence to go after him and probe his administration of corruption to do so.
He said his administration will hunt down anyone who has siphoned state funds in the past, saying that “the aim was to mop every kobo stolen and such moneys would be ploughed back to develop while allowing democratic principles to prevail.
Speaking at an interactive session with beneficiaries of the Federal Government’s Social Investment Programmes in Jos, Lalong said he is determined to set a precedence for transparency in governance.
“It is also to set the tone for future governmental operations where every governor must adhere to due process and eschew corruption”, he said.
Responding the Publicity Secretary of the People Democratic Party (PDP), Plateau State, John Akans, said Gov. Lalong should stop deceiving the public as he will not only be arrested after his tenure come 2019 but will also be prosecuted.

He said the Governor has borrowed more than N42bn in just two years without any tangible project to show for it.
His words, “In just two years, the APC administration has borrowed more than N42bn with no tangible results to show.
“The Governor has not been able to articulate and enunciate clear economic and social policies that will leave marked improvements in the lives of the people of the State.
“The Governor’s lack of vision has turned the Government House into an exclusive club where impunity, imposition and total disregard for constitutionalism have become the order of the day”, Akans said.
