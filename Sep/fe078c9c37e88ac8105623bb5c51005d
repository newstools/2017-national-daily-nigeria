Neymar has allegedly unfollowed his teammate, Edinson Cavani on social media following a contention over set-piece duties at PSG’s 2-0 win over Lyon on Sunday.
Initially, after a free kick was awarded to PSG on Sunday, Dani Alves came on to shield Cavani from taking the free-kick, giving his fellow Brazilian, Neymar, a chance at the set-piece.
Afterwards, in the 79th minute of the game, PSG were awarded a penalty. This generated another spat between the two forwards.
Cavani was in the process of taking the penalty when Neymar tried to intervene and take the shot instead.

Cavani successfully stood firm to take the penalty which he eventually missed.
A few minutes later PSG scored the second goal of the game from another gifted own goal by Lyon.
Cavani and Neymar had also debated who was to take the spot kick against St. Etienne. The tension seems to be gathering momentum with each game played.

The fights have since prompted Neymar un-following his fellow forward, Cavani, on Instagram which has riled up fans on social media.

Neymar was reported to have left Barcelona to step out of the shadow of Lionel Messi so it is little surprise that he wants to take all responsibilities for all goal scoring chances.
PSG boss Unai Emery has so far remained diplomatic but hinted he may have to intervene if the two players cannot resolve their differences.
“The penalties are to be struck by a few players, one is Cavani and the other is Neymar. It takes a gentleman’s agreement on the ground to hit the penalties. Afterwards, we will arrange internally for the penalties that are coming in, because I think both are able to score them, and I want the two to alternate in this exercise. If there is no agreement, I will decide. I do not want it to be a problem for us” – Unai Emery
