A group of protesters identified as members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), stormed the United Nations office in New York, protesting the killing of their members in South East Nigeria by the Nigerian Army on the order of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The protesters insisted they were agitating against the killings and destruction of property of Igbos during the military invasion of Abia State and the expansion of Operation Python Dance II in South East states. .
In a video retrieved online, the people could be seen chanting war songs in Igbo language while carrying flags of the proposed Biafra nation.
The protest was going while President Buhari was addressing the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on Tuesday. The protesting was embarrassing to the Nigerian President.
