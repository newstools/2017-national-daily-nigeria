A 55-year old woman identified as Josephine Igbineweka has been killed by her last child, Caleb Obasogie.
Caleb, 22, reportedly killed his mother over her refusal to give him money.
The killing occurred around 8:00 a.m. at their residence in Benin City, Edo State.
Eyewitnesses said Caleb locked himself and his mother in one of the rooms and used broken bottle to stab her repeatedly until her intestines were ripped out.
He reportedly dangled her mother’s intestines before neighbours could rush in to rescue her.

National daily gathered that the deceased passed the night at a neighbour’s house because her son locked her out for not giving him the money he demanded.
Caleb is a final year student of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) while his late mother was a beer parlour operator in Benin City.
The Spokesman of the Edo State Police Command, DSP Moses Nkombe, confirmed the incident, saying the son has been arrested by the police.
