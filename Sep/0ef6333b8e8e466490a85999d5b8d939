The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 82 Division, Nigerian Army, Maj Gen. Adamu Abubakar, has said that Exercise Python Dance 2 was not targeted at any group, but to ensure united country where everyone was safe.

He further explained in Onitsha on Tuesday that the exercise conducted by Nigerian Army explained that the ongoing Operation Python Dance 2 was also targeted at criminal elements in the South East.

Speaking at the training camp of the exercise in Oba, near Onitsha, Gen Abubakar reiterated that “the police gave reports of crimes in Anambra and it became necessary that the Army should step in to assist.

“The level of crime has drastically reduced now. The Nigerian Army will always respect human rights as enshrined in our Rule of Engagement and Code of Conduct for which every soldier has a copy.

“Human rights groups are there and we just have to respect it; as we are doing, we also urge the press to report exactly what they see.

“We should not be sentimental about things; we should look more at national interest, rather than personal and parochial interest when dealing with security issues.”

The GOC further added that the choice of Oba was borne out of space noting that “the exercise in the state was also to enable soldiers, particularly the young ones to see how internal security outside the barracks is carried out,” he added.

He used the opportunity to commission the reconstructed Onitsha Military Cantonment gate, two water boreholes of 48,000 gallons capacity at the cantonment.




National Daily learnt that personnel of the Army, Nigerian Prisons Service, Navy, Police, FRSC, NSCDC, Nigerian Immigration Service and DSS were all represented at the Operation Python Dance 2 camp in Oba.
