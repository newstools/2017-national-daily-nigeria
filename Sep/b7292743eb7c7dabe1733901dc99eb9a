An Egor Magistrates’ Court sitting in Benin City, Edo State on Thursday sentenced a 25-year old man, Ekene Nwane, to 14 years imprisonment for abducting an eight-year girl, Success Imasuen, for money ritual.
The prosecutors said the convict dressed in a red gown, grabbed and hypnotized the victim while she was playing with her sister near their mother’s shop.
The mother, Everlyn Imasuen, after making fruitless attempt to rescue her daughter from Nwane alerted passers-by who helped to arrest the convict.
