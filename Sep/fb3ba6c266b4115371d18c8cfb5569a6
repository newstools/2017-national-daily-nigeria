Demand for money for stationery and for bail has prompted the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State CP Edgal Imohimi to create a special unit known as “Citizen Complaint Hot Centre” with 10 dedicated phone lines.
The police boss disclosed that the era of police demanding money from complainants to buy biro and papers before writing or obtaining statements from them and paying to secure bail are over.
He told National Daily while addressing a stakeholders meeting under Area “A” Command that complainant should endeavour to call any of the lines should any policeman demand for money for bail or stationeries before obtaining statement from him/her.
Also, the police boss disclosed that henceforth it was compulsory for every policeman serving in Lagos Command to have a pen and paper in his pocket to record incidences, complaints by members of the public and to take important notes where necessary.
The new numbers include: 08067945296; 08063025274; 08063104759; 08113615350; 08113683079; 08096283148; 08096283173; 08089781657; 08126404930 and 08081426895.

He observed that spurious corruption among officers has strained the relationship between the police and members of the public and that has, by extension, dampened the enthusiasm to report or give credible information to the police that would have helped them in fighting crime effectively and efficiently.
Imohimi used the opportunity to give one week mandate to area commanders and divisional police officers to raid uncompleted buildings and market after such market has closed for business for the day, saying “market was not a place for abode.”
He further disclosed that the State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has approved 109 generating sets for all the Divisional Police Stations in the state. 
In addition, the governor has also approved flash light which will lead to the launching of “Operation Light Up all police station” in Lagos state.
The Commissioner who spoke at a Town Hall meeting with stakeholders under Area “A” Command mandated Area Command and DPOs to check the activities of Tricycles and motorbikes who are presently “constituting nuisance to the state.”
