says letter is authentic

The Police Service Commission (PSC) on Wednesday said the retirement letter Senator Isa Haman Missau presented to the world and described by the Nigerian Police as fake,  is “authentic” after all.
Senator Isah Misau, Chairman Senate Committee on Navy was alleged to have forged his retirement letter after he deserted the police force as a Deputy Superintendent of Police about seven years ago.
PSC reiterated the senator followed the due process having genuinely retired. National Daily recalled that the Nigeria Police Force on August 27 declared Misau a “deserter”, and accused him of carrying a forged retirement letter.
It was further learnt that Misau was invited by the Commission to appear before its special panel investigating the genuineness or otherwise of the two letters of retirement emanating from the Commission.
Misau, in a series of interviews with newsmen, accused the Inspector General of Police of taking bribe to post police officers as well as diverting for personal use money paid by private companies for police duties.

The Head, Press and Public Relations of the Commission, Ikechukwu Ani, disclosed to NAN in Abuja that the committee confirmed that the letter was issued by the Commission.
He said that Misau, who did not appear before the committee, did not give any reason for his absence.
Ani said the retirement letter with Ref. No: PSC 1034 Vol.8/244 was issued on March 4, 2014, but took effect from December 1, 2010.
He said Misau’s retirement followed due process and was based on a recommendation from the Force Headquarters.
It would be recalled that the Force Police Public Relations, CSP Jimoh presented to the press a copy of the forged letter which has now been confirmed as authentic.
