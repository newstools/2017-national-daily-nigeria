Without any apparent frustration or sighs of depression, a director in the Ministry of Youth and Social Development in Lagos State committed suicide by hanging himself with a band of Aso Oke, a local fabric, in his own room.

Oludare Buraimoh until his death on Tuesday lived with his family in Unity Estate, Phase 11 Gbonagun area of Abeokuta, Ogun State.

Ogun State Police Command Public Relations Officer Abimbola Oyeyemi said the director took his life a few hours after giving his son Dotun malaria drugs .

” The corpse has been deposited in the mortuary as investigation continues,” Mr. Oyeyemi said.

Oyeyemi added the son of the deceased reported the case at the Obantoko Divisional Police Headquarters.

The son said that the incident happened around 4 p.m.

“We were both at home. He came to give me a drug and left me (and I was) thinking he was going to retire to his room. But when I did not hear his voice I called him, but got no response,” he said.

“I, thereafter, went to his room only to find him hanging from the ceiling with a traditional ‘aso oke’ (attire) tied to his neck and a stool with which he committed the suicide.”

Their neighbours, on hearing this, asked Dotun to inform the police.

Buraimoh’s widow still cannot say exactly what led her husband to this.
