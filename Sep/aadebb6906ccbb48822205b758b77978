The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has advised on the planned shut-down of the nation’s three refineries at the same time for complete overhaul.
 
The Union commends the Buhari administration for the political will to rehabilitate the refineries but warned that it will not tolerate a situation whereby workers jobs are jeopardised.
 
It believed that the two-unions in the Oil and Gas sector, NUPENG and PENGASSAN with other stakeholders should be taken along in the new arrangement in order to forestall industrial action. 
 
It stated that the union had all along clamoured for the Turn-Around-Maintenance of the nation’s three refineries but advised that it should be done in such a way that the workers’ jobs are protected.

In a statement by the President, Comrade (Dr) Achese Igwe, NUPENG added that the plan closure and TAM should not be used for enriching some cronies because of the astronomical volume of monies that will be involved. 
 
The Union therefore calls for a monitoring committee to oversee all aspects of the overhaul.
 
The Union warned that it will not tolerate a situation where workers will be used as guinea pigs or eased out under the guise of a complete shut-down of the three refineries.
It stressed that the period should be used to train and re-train the workers to meet the new challenges that will be faced after the overhaul.
 
It added that the move is a good step in the right direction towards local self-sufficiency in petroleum products by 2019, but must be done in a manner that human capital is protected.
