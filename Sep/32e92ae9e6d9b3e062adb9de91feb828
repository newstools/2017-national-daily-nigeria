The Spanish football league wants the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to investigate whether Manchester City has broken financial fair play rules.

European football’s governing body is already investigating if Paris St-Germain has broken rules designed to stop clubs from ‘financial doping’.

La Liga president Javier Tebas said City and PSG’s “funding by state-aid distorts European competitions; however, reports say UEFA has no intention of opening an investigation into City at this stage.

City and PSG spent hundreds of millions of pounds on new players this summer.
