No fewer than 21, 064 police officers will descend in Anambra to secure the November guber election in the southeastern state.

The Nigeria Police Force is taking that decision considering threats by some groups in the region to disrupt the election.

IGP Ibrahim Idris, however, said police have identified some local government areas in the state, believed to be strongholds of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).

“Ihiala Local Government in the state has been marked as an IPOB stronghold that needs serious security presence during the elections.”

According to him, the Force would not condone any act of indiscipline during the election, warning that any person or group found culpable would be dealt with.

“No groups under any guise will be allowed to disrupt or cause violence before and during and after the election,” he added.
