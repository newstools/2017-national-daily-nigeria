Former Nigeria President, Goodluck Jonathan has denied claims by the Imo State Governor, Rochas okorocha that he (Jonathan) demanded his favour so as to win the Southeast zone during the 2015 General Election.
In a statement issued by the spokesman to the ex-President, Ikechukwu Eze, he stated that no bribe was offered to Okorocha to deliver the Southeast zone to him.
Besides, he appealed to the Imo State Governor, to focus on the successful administration of his  State and avoid being drawn into issues that could affect him.

“In the first place, it sounded irrational and absurd. Besides, it was obvious to all and sundry that the south-east, being Dr Jonathan’s political stronghold, the ex-President did not need Okorocha to win in the zone.
“However, to set the record straight, we make bold to say that former President Jonathan
never made any contact with Okorocha, ahead of the 2015 elections.
“All those who had either worked closely with him in any capacity or served in Jonathan’s administration can bear testimony to the fact that idle talk is not his style.
“Governor Okorocha would have served his state better if he directed his enormous drive to
creating growth and development opportunities for the good people of Imo state, rather than allowing himself to be drawn into dissipating his energy on platitudes and propaganda,” the statement said.
