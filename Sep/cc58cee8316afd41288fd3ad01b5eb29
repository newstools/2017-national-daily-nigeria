The University of Benin (UNIBEN) on Wednesday announced the postponement of the post UTME test that was scheduled to hold between 14th and 25th September, 2017.




The Registrar, Mrs O.A Oshodin in a statement made available to National Daily explained that the ongoing strike by the Non-Academic Staff of University (NASU) was responsible for the decision, adding that a new date would be announced later.

While regretting the inconveniences the postponement might have caused for students and parents, enjoin candidates who applied for the screening exercise to check the university’s website (www.Uniben.edu) regularly for updates on new date for the examinations.
