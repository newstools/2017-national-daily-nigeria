Edinson Cavani has reportedly rejected a €1million bonus in exchange for conceding Paris Saint-Germain’s penalties to Neymar, National Daily gathered.

Cavani would receive the bonus for finishing the season as Ligue 1’s top goalscorer.

However, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, has reportedly offered to pay out that sum, whether or not he finishes atop the scoring charts. Only on the condition that he surrenders penalty duties to his Brazilian team-mate.

Al-Khelaifi is also understood to have sent representatives to convince Neymar to drop the dispute, explaining that the world’s most expensive footballer, should allow Cavani take penalties to maintain his confidence up front.

However, the former Barcelona forward apparently did not agree with that logic.
