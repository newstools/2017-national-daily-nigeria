Orava, 72, is a specialist in muscle injuries and has worked with some of the most high-profile star in world sport.

He’s helped treat the likes of David Beckham, Didier Deschamps and Pep Guardiola.

The experienced doctor has close links with Barcelona and has recently helped injury-plagued former Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen.
