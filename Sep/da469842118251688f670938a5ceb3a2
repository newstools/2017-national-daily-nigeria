The National Association of Resident Doctors has declared an indefinite strike action pending when the federal and state governments resolved all outstanding issues in the health sector.
Rising from a meeting that lasted until 3am this morning, President of the association, Dr. John Onyebueze said the doctors have decided to go on a total indefinite strike until government meet all their demands.
Recall that National Daily had reported an earlier ultimatum by the association last year where it demanded immediate implementation of pending agreements between the government and health sector.

Dr. Onyebueze demanded the immediate implementation of pending agreements between the government and health workers, warning that the association “cannot guarantee industrial harmony in the health sector if this persists beyond the payment of September salaries”.
Onyebueze said that the association was demanding the immediate upgrade of infrastructure in teaching hospitals as well as the immediate release and implementation of the report on the Residency Training Programme.
He added that the association was unhappy with the disruption of the structure of the residency programme by chief medical directors of teaching hospitals.
Listing the grievances of the resident doctors, he added, “Are you talking about the rickety beds in the accident and emergency wards? We do not even have gloves and emergency tools. “We do not have pens to write and make prescriptions. We are saying that this thing must not continue.
