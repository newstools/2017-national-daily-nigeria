A senator representing Cross River South, Gershom Bassey, is not happy about the attacks and killings by Fulani herdsmen in some parts of the state.

He pointed out on Tuesday during  a stakeholders meeting in Cross River that he was working round the clock to ensure that there was an end to the circle of killings by the herdsmen.

Senator Bassey, who reacted to herdsmen attack in Obio Usiere community in Odukpani Local Government Area, said it was no longer business as usual to allow the killings to continue and therefore, vowed to get to the root of series of herdsmen attacks in the state.

He expressed disappointment with the Odukpani attack, noting that this was not the first time such attack would be carried out.

He said, “I condemn the killing in Odukpani local Government Area in its entirety. There is no room for such attack in Nigeria. The elders are looking for ways to resolve the problem.

“Stakeholders in the state will get to the root of the problem but we don’t want people to take the law into their hands. We are engaging the elders; I have also engaged the House of Assembly member representing area to put a permanent stop to such attacks.”

He observed that a situation where people take laws into their hands and kill other indigenes under any guise of rearing cattle was not acceptable and condemned it in its entirety.

Although the number of casualty was not made known during the attack, the lawmaker pointed out that they have engaged the police to get the actual number of people killed in the attack.

National Daily recalls that during the first attack at Odukpani, nobody was killed.
Since January, herdsmen have killed people especially farmers in Benue, Kaduna, Enugu, Anambra, Edo, Taraba, Plateau, Delta and some other states in the country.

Latest attack in Benue state yesterday left two people dead.
