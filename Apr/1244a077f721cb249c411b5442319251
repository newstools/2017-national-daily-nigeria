Vote By Democracy Is Count Of The Majority And Unidentified Majority Will Mean The UK General Election Would Be A Sham — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas
Our Bricks Must Be Solid, Our Walls Must Be Firm, Our Decision Is Ponderous And Our Will Must Be Tempestuous — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas.
I say to you Prime Minister Theresa May, the European Union Citizens must not be allowed to  Vote in the UK General Election;
Hence Britain has lost Count of over 2 Million European Union (EU) Citizens resident in the United Kingdom as a result of Flawed Migration from the Port of Carley, a Port of Entry into UK from France. Allowing these People I call the Children of Anomalies, if preferences is given that they be allowed to Vote in the UK General election, it will be a pretentious detriment a cartelist that will ruin the Future of Great Britain, meaning the UK General Election will be Rigged.
SO THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS AVAILABLE:

INSTALL OF CURFEW

EU Citizens must be Prohibited in the UK General Election because this is about Brexit, the Centre Podium of British Sovereignty and if that should be the Case, 24 Hours before the Election, all EU Citizens in United Kingdom and her Territories and Borders of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland  must be placed on Curfew.
All EU Citizens are to stay indoors and not come out to the Streets within the Period of Voting to avoid Chaos, to avoid Misrepresentation by means of False Identity, to avoid Terrorism, to avoid Mayhem, to avoid Confusion and to avoid Rigging the Election itself.

USE OF EXECUTIVE POWER 

Conservative Party, the Ruling Government can use her Executive Powers to Cancel, Suspend or  Nullify the UK General Election.
Since, the Politics and its Twin, Twine and String is about British Independence, British Democracy, British Heritage and British People. No External Voice matters, only Politics in the House by the Government and her Cabinet.
PROTOCOL 
So, I say in simple definition, the Government has Two Options:

Prohibit EU Citizens without British Passport from Voting

or

Stay in Power Unconditionally till 2022.

The Government and Advisory Council are Knowledgeable enough to decide the new Manifesto for Her England, Her Great Britain, Her Ireland, Her Scotland and Her Wales.
ACTION
So, I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas say unto Theresa May, if Option 1 of Curfew fails, they should, must and by Mandate of Executive Powers without the Court, because the Court is equally part of the Government and because the Government has willed the interest for Motherland, the Conservative Party should remain in Power in the next Four years and  all acts of Political Reforms, Political Laws, Political Chess be suspended for the Government to redress how the New Britain would be fashioned for the Future for Today and Tomorrow.
DECORUM OF AUTHORITY

I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas rest my Case because Prime Minister Theresa May’s Government will now sit and decide sooner than later after their meeting with Advisory Council, Her Cabinet, Her VERITAS of Authority will address the great nation of United Kingdom.
I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas leave Theresa May’s Government in your hands because they are equally as Knowledgeable as myself. They are Women and Men of Leadership, I am just a Wise one to aid them with Light spoken through me as a Messenger of Truth.
I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas, Thank Theresa May for standing for the Values and Virtues of the Great Nation of United Kingdom for bringing yourself forward in the Selfless Service of Government. Your Reign shall never be forgotten in History.
I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas, Thank the Government of Theresa May, Thank you the Advisory Council, Thank you the VERITAS of Authority. All your Names shall be enshrined in the History of the Great Empire of United Kingdom.
I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas say to the World, I have found peace inside of me in releasing the Truth and Substance of Truth in that ‘Every judgement I have made against the Conservative Party in the Past, I withdraw them. They shall Count No more and has no defection on them.
I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas is an Eagle, a Guardian Angel in the Realm of the English Orthodox. My Spoken Words are inscribed on the Slate for Conventional Men to learn the way of the English Orthodox.

SECURITY ALERT
Embracing a Model and Government Reformation, the Security of the Leader is the Future and Greatness of the United Kingdom, because Prime Minister Theresa May is the Voice, the Hope and the Future to Turbine the Wheel of Authority — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas

Men cannot be trusted, hence EU is facing a Disaster, hence the World is bemused that United Kingdom regains her lost glories lost in the slump of a failed ideology of European Union the jokers of Europe, hence Political Rivals could be a Threat, since everybody has Divided Ideologies, in that Theresa May’s Ideology cannot be contended with;
