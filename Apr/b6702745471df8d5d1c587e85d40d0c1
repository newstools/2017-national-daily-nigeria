Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has ordered telecoms companies illegally using certain spectrum, issuing them with a 14-day ultimatum to quit such spectrum or face the music.
According to the Commission, the use of any spectrum not duly licensed by any operator is criminal and could lead to imprisonment.
Prof. Umar Danbatta, executive vice chairman of the NCC, particularly warned the all unauthorized users of 5.470-5.725 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum band to desist from doing so in order not to incur the wrath of the Commission.

“The Nigerian Communications Commission hereby informs the general public that the 5.4GHz band spanning 5.470 – 5.725 GHz frequency range is a licensed band in Nigeria,” Dambatta said.
According to him, transmission of signals or use of equipment in any form on the band without a frequency license obtained from the NCC is illegal and shall not be tolerated.
He warned all concerned operators and companies or any person(s) using the band to note that it was a criminal offence pursuant to the section 122 of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003 to operate on any frequency not duly assigned by the Commission.
