IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu has perfected has met his bail conditions—sureties who are leaders in politics, business and Judaism, the religion the separatist leader claims he belongs.

“Nnamdi Kanu’s bail has been perfected,” said his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, Friday afternoon. “Nnamdi Kanu has met his bail conditions.”

The Federal High Court, Abuja, had on Tuesday admitted Mr. Kanu to bail on health grounds, but gave seemingly tough conditions, which included having ‘a highly respected’ Jewish leader, a ‘senior highly placed person of Igbo extraction such as a senator’; and a highly respected person who owns landed property and is resident in Abuja as sureties.

South-east senators were said to gather Thursday night at the Apo, Abuja, residence of the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, where they resolved to help Kanu perfect his bail.

Sen. Eyinnaya Abaribe and Theodore Orji were asked to stand as surety in fulfilment of the conditions to produce a ‘respected’ Igbo leader.

Abaribe eventually accepted to stand in as a political leader, followed by a Jewish High Chief Priest Immanuu-El Shalom, and a chartered accountant residing in Abuja, Tochukwu Uchendu.

Kanu was first arrested on October 14, 2015 by the operatives of the State Security Service. He has since been kept in detention though court granted him bail several time.
