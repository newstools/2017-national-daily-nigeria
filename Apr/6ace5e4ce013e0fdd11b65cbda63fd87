The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said on Tuesday there has been considerable improvement in the Quality of Service (QoS) provided by telecommunication companies in the first quarter of 2017.
The NCC Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, made the assertion shortly after the presentation of the NCC’s Performance Report by the Director General of the Bureau of Public Service Reforms, Dr. Joe Abah, to the management of the commission.
Prof. Danbatta maintained that Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that define QoS had been put in place for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) assessment.
“The result of the assessment in the 1st quarter of 2017 has shown improvement in QoS by telecommunication companies,” the NCC chief stated.

He, however, added that NCC would leave no stone unturned in its bid to provide the best for telecom consumers across the country.
A statement signed by the NCC Director of Public Affairs, Mr. Tony Ojobo, noted that “very strong business organizational structure, policies and practices that facilitate effective and efficient service delivery were some of the high points, the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) considered before naming the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) top in institutional work processes in the country.”
He said the Director General of BPSR also presented a plaque to Prof. Danbatta during the event at the NCC Headquarters in Abuja.
