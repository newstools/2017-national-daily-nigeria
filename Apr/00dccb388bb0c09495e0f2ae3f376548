The National President, Nigerian Army Officers’ Wives Association (NAOWA), Mrs Umma-Kalsum Buratai, has called on every victim of sexual harassment not to be mute about it but speak out and be heard.

She pointed out that the only way to deal with problems of sexual harassment was for the victims to make noise so that suspects would be exposed.

Mrs Buratai, who spoke in Lagos while receiving the wife of Bangladeshi Chief of Army Staff, Mrs Shoma Huq, at the NAOWA Secretariat in Ikoyi, said the association had organised awareness programmes and campaigns to that effect.

At the NAOWA vocational centres, where entrepreneurship trainings were being carried out, including  entrepreneurship skills such as fashion designing, catering, computer acquisition skills, Mrs Huq expressed joy with the high quality of learning and teaching.
