Talented actresses, Tonto Dikeh and Toyin Aimakhu have joined the star-studded list of speakers for forthcoming Nigerian Entertainment Conference NECLive.
The duo have been selected because of their vast knowledge – albeit at times controversial – of the fast-growing Nigerian filmmaking industry.
NECLive is the umbrella conference for the entertainment industry in Nigeria, providing an opportunity for strategic discussions, and a marketplace for ideas, products and services.

The organisers say this year’s edition will focus on how Nigerian entertainment, and indeed entertainment from Africa is finding renewed favour with fans at home, and the world over.
NECLive5 will feature some of the most important players in the sector, from pathfinders Ali Baba and Opa Williams, to trail blazers Basketmouth, Basorge Tariah, Tee A, Frank Donga, and Teju Babyface. This year will feature a workshop on comedy, featuring established and fast rising acts.
