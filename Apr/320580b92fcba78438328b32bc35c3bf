 The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) said it is advocating several causes to ensure that economic policies are in tune with reality, while ensuring that the banking profession is held in high esteem.
The President/Chairman of Council of the Institute, Prof. Olusegun Ajibola stated this recently in preparatory to the World Conference of Banking Institutes, WCBI.
He said the conference has potential to contribute to the nation’s economy, as it would help operators showcase the country as an investment destination while negating the perception held about the economy.
Besides, the CIBN boss stated that the institute would as part of its objectives, use the World Conference of Banking Institutes (WCBI) to address the negative perceptions held by investors about Nigeria in a bid to encourage necessary foreign investments needed to reflate the economy.

“From April 24-28, 2017, the who-is-who in the world of banking and finance will gather at Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos to “Re-Think the Future of Banking and Finance and Life-Long Learning” as well as its derivative sub-themes: Re-professionalising banking through continuous education; dynamics of competition; the need for and role of banking/finance standards; among others”.
He said that Nigeria stands to benefit from the conference when the banking and finance industry plays its roles in catalysing economic growth by showcasing the nation to investors as well as promote ethical professionalism and good corporate governance.
Meanwhile, the CIBN boss also revealed that the Institute has resolved financial disputes valued at over N15 billion between customers and deposit money banks, even as it continues to promote global best practices among operators.
Ajibola disclosed that the CIBN over the years have been able to address concerns bordering on ethics and professionalism without recourse to litigation through its sub-ethics and professionalism committee, while equally deploying sanctions to deter operators from abusing privileges and positions.
