According to Uzodinma, the Committee discovered high level manipulation of foreign exchange of around N30trillion which was purchase on behalf of importers by banks, and was illegally transferred out of Nigeria which resulted into the current forex scarcity.
Uzondinma said that ‘FORM M’, designed by the Nigeria Customs and Excise Duties for importation of goods, was used to carry out the foreign exchange manipulations.
