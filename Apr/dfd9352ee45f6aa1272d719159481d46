The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Wednesday announced that it uncovered foreign currencies and naira notes worth $43.4 million, £27,800 and N23.2 million at a four-bedroom apartment in Ikoyi, Lagos.

The total amount of money recovered at the current Central Bank exchange rate is over N13 billion.

The commission’s Lagos office got information regarding movement of bags in and out of a particular apartment in the building.

A source in the neighbourhood said that a woman usually appeared on different occasions with ‘Ghana Must Go’ bags, the EFCC said.

“She comes looking haggard, with dirty clothes but her skin didn’t quite match her outward appearance, perhaps a disguise”, the source said.

The guards at the gate also explained that nobody resides in the apartment, but some persons come in and out once in a while.

“The EFCC operatives used minimum force to enter the apartment,” the EFCC said in a statement said.

Monies were found in two of the four bedroom apartment. Further probe of the wardrobe by operatives in one of the rooms, yielded three fire proof cabinets hidden behind wooden panels of the wardrobe. 

Inside the cabinets were bails of US dollars, pound sterling and naira notes .

The commission said the funds are suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activity .
