Valentine Obienyem, a media aide to Peter Obi, ex-governor of Anambra, has said the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, didn’t find any incriminating thing in his apartment at Osborne Towers, Ikoyi.
The search on Obi’s apartment followed the discovery of N13billion in one of the apartments at the luxury building.
Obienyem said Obi and wife usually stay in the apartment anytime they are in Lagos.

“Even though Mr. and Mrs Obi had travelled to the USA and the UK for speaking engagements, when we relayed the message of the search to him, he quickly sent the keys to the 4-bedroom apartment to the EFCC via courier,” the statement read.
“He even left instructions that we should allow them to also search his Onitsha residence should there be need for that. After the thorough searching, nothing was found in the apartment.”
