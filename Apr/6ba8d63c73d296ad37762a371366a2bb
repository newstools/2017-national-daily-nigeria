Since the media got briefed of the marital havoc experienced by Tonto Dikeh in her marriage to Churchill, it has been one squabble to another from both parties.  As Tonto continuously uses her social media pages to explain why she left the broken marriage, her fans and followers would rather she shut up and move on.  “The fact you lied to your followers about being in a comfortable relationship and using your media power to hype the so called ‘Psychopath’ is an abuse on everybody. Yea it feels so good when you start dating him but I’m sure you can tell at some point that it doesn’t feel right but you chose to push on with it. Madam Move on with your life shit happens”, the fan snapped.

The fan was obviously referring to the time when Tonto Dikeh revealed that all the stuffs posted on her Instagram page including the Lexus 570 jeep and jewelleries claiming her husband bought were all lies.
Interestingly, Tonto Dikeh, or MamaKing as she now calls herself found the time to respond to the troll, not missing the opportunity to shade her hubby, saying all pretence about expensive gifts given to her by her husband on social media was to make him grow and not to fool anyone. She wrote:

“That am really sorry I did. I didn’t do it to fool no one. I wanted this man to grow and it worked. People don’t associate with losers or not relevant people. I have no excuse for my behaviour but my intention here was solely to help a man grow!!”
