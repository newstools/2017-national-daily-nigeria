An Abuja based woman has approached a Mararaba Grade 1 Area Court,  praying the judge to terminate her marriage over inadequate sex.

Thirty-year-old Bilkisu Lawal told the court that her husband, Shuaibu Yusuf, had denied her sex for two years.

National Daily learnt that Bilkisu was married to Yusuf in January 2012, according to Islamic rites, and the marriage is blessed with a son.

The petitioner narrated that things began to change in October 2014 after she gave birth to the only child of the marriage.

Bilikisu reiterated that before she came in terms with what was happening, the husband stopped coming to her room.

She narrated, “Sometimes in October 2014, about six months after the birth of my son, my husband stopped having sex with me but he provides for the family.

“On several occasions, I have asked what I did wrong, but he will not tell me. In December 2016, he sent me out of the house for no reason.

“Since then, he never bothered to know where my son and I are staying; neither did he bring money for his son’s upkeep.

“I have been living with my parents and I cannot continue to live as a married woman when my husband does not see me as a wife to have sex with in the last two years” Bilkisu explained.

She further added that at a point,  she reported the lack of sex matter to the family and they brokered peace between them.

It was gathered that soon after she got back, the privation continued.




Responding in his defence, the husband, Yusuf, acknowledged the fact that he was still in love with his wife but said he has been undergoing some financial problems hence he sent the wife to his parent’s house.

The presiding judge, Owuna Musa, adjourned the matter until April 28 for the couple to find a common ground to settle and report back to the court or the hearing in the divorce suit will continue.
