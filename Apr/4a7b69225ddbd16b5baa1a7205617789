It is without doubt that the 2016 financial year was a rather challenging macroeconomic environment for many businesses to operate under. But shareholders of some Deposit Money Banks (DMOs) have cause to jubilate despite the macroeconomic challenges.
According to National Daily findings, seven banks have so far made public their reports for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. All declared dividends for their shareholders, except for Wema Bank and Union Bank.
Zenith International Bank Plc led the pack. It declared a profit after tax of N129.65 as against the N105.66 billion recorded in 2015 and a final dividend of N1.77 per share, an improvement over the N1.55 per share paid in 2015.
The bank had earlier in 2016 paid a sum of 25k as interim dividend, bringing the total dividend in 2016 to N2.02 per share against N1.80 per share declared in 2015.
The bank’s gross earnings grew by 17.4 per cent to N507. 99 billion compared with N432.54 billion recorded in 2015. Its non-interest income increased by 45.9 per cent to N25.59 billion due to an 809 per cent increase in foreign exchange revaluation gains of N25.6 billion. This however, declined by 10 per cent from the N8.2 billion reported in nine months of 2016.
Guaranty Trust Bank came second with a N1.75 final dividends to its shareholders from a N132 billion profit after tax. This brings the total dividend to N2.00 per share because it earlier paid an interim dividend of 25 kobo.

United Bank for Africa came third, declaring a 75 kobo final dividend. The bank approved payment of final dividend of N19.9 billion for the financial year ended Dec. 31, 2016.
The dividend translates to a final dividend of 55k per share, against 40k per share paid in 2015. This is in addition to the 20k interim dividend earlier paid by the bank, bringing the total dividend to 75k, against 60k declared in 2015.
