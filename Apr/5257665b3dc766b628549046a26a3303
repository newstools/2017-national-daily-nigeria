The Confluence Queens’ goalkeeper Vincent Mercy remained confident of increasing her clean sheets this season when her side take on Osun Babes of Oshogbo this Wednesday in the Matchday 3 of Nigeria Women Premier League, NWPL in Lokoja.
The Edo born safe hand  told National Daily that she has kept two clean sheets in the opening two matches for the New Direction Queens against Delta Queens and Nasarawa Amazons, while warning her team mates to be wary ahead of Osun Babes’ visit to the Confluence Stadium
“My personal target this season is to maintain as many clean sheets as possible for the team, I will continue to work hard to contribute my quota for the team to achieve our set targets “.

” Osun Babes are not a bad side, but we will not leave any stone unturned against them” Mercy said.
“Our focus is on the three points, we are not ready to joke or underrate any team because whoever is playing in the NWPL stand a chance to challenge”.
The last time both side met in Lokoja, Osun Babes snatched a point after a goalless draw and the Queens will be seeking all means to avoid similar scenario of what happened last two season.
Confluence Queens are second on group B table behind Adamawa Queens who tops on goals difference and a good goals margin for the Coach Tenimu Nayashi ‘Maja’ led side might shoot them to the top of the log. Osun Babes seat fourth with a point separating both teams after two games respectively.
