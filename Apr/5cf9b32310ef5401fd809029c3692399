Members of The Gambia Bar Association, GBA, have protested against the appointment of four Nigerians as High Court judges. They claimed the appointment was not in line with the 1997 Constitution of the country.
The newly appointed judges include: Justice Edward Ogar, Justice Mathias Olusegun Agboola, Justice Simeon Abi and Justice Matins U. Okoi
The Secretary-General of the association in a statement said the group would file an action challenging the said appointments. Also, the group said its members would commence a boycott of the courts presided over by the appointed judges until further notice.

The GBA added that it had filed a suit against the Judicial Service Commission and Attorney-General on March 28, 2017. The suit seeks the suspension of the judges’ appointments.
More so, the association said it was saddened by the disrespect shown by the country’s judicial system for not appointing qualified and eminent Gambian judges.
