Former England and Aston Villa defender Ugo Ehiogu has died following a cardiac arrest, Tottenham Hotspur said on Friday.

Reuters reported the 44-year-old, who worked as Tottenham’s under-23 coach, was rushed to hospital after collapsing at the club’s training ground on Thursday.

He received immediate treatment at the hospital. But he passed away in the early hours of Friday, the English Premier League club said in a statement.

“Words cannot express the shock and sadness that we all feel at the Club,” said Tottenham’s head of coaching and development John McDermott. “Ugo’s immense presence will be irreplaceable.”
