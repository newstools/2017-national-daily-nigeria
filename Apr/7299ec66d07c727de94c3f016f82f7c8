SGF David Babachir and Nigeria Intelligence Agency’s DG Ayodele Oke, both suspended yesterday for different misconducts, were short of words when journalists confronted them yesterday at Aso Rock.

The duo were supposed to meet Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to discuss issue surrounding the $50 million unearthed at Ikoyi, Lagos, last week, and the presidential panel reports that probed Babachir earlier.

But it was Babachir only that was able to meet the vice president.

Oke, while trying to avoid journalists, darted about villa as security aides prevented him from taking the VP exit gate and that of the service chiefs.

Neither of them could say anything to the press.

Presidential spokesperson Femi Adesina, on Wednesday, said the president ordered an investigation into the allegations of violations of law and due process made against Babchir in the award of contracts under the Presidential Initiative on the North East, PINE.

The President also ordered a full-scale investigation into the discovery of large amounts of foreign and local currencies by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, in a residential apartment at Osborne Towers, Ikoyi, Lagos, over which the National Intelligence Agency, NIA, has made a claim.

“The investigation is also to enquire into the circumstances in which the NIA came into possession of the funds, how and by whose or which authority the funds were made available to the NIA, and to establish whether or not there has been a breach of the law or security procedure in obtaining custody and use of the funds.

Oke had earlier explained the fund was meant for a covert operation in the last administration.

But sources said his wife Folashade had been couriering sackloads of money into the luxury apartment all along.
