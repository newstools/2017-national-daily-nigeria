A man, Francis Stephen, 48, has told an Igando Customary Court, in Lagos, on Wednesday that his wife, Ogechi Stephen, is having a tryst with his younger brother and her pastor.
“My wife is sleeping with her pastor, when I got to know I confronted her and she confessed to me. Apart from having sex with her pastor, she was also cheating on me with my younger brother”, he said.
Francis, who has been married to his wife for 13 years, said the latter ran away with their four kids. He prayed the court to grant him custody of the children.
“Last year, my wife absconded with our children to her village without my consent, she later sent me a message that she had gotten to her family in Imo and that she is no longer interested in the marriage.
“Please grant me the custody of my children because my wife is not working, she cannot take care of them, she just wants to punish me by denying me access to them,” he said.
However, the petitioner, Ogechi, said that her husband beat her on slightest provocation. She added that the complainant had sought fetish means to kill her.

“There was a night he was inciting incantation calling demonic power to kill me”, she said.
She added her husband is a heavy smoker and drinker.
Ogechi begged the court to dissolve the union. But the husband told the court not to grant his wife’s wish because he still cared for her.
The court president, Adegboyega Omilola, adjourned the case till June 6, for further hearing.
