‎Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola, CEO of Wecyclers has urged Nigerians to adopt a waste-recycling lifestyle as an effective means of addressing diverse health issues. ‎
She said this during an interview on ‘Your View’, a daytime talk show on Channels Television which aired on Tuesday, April 18, 2017.
#LagosIsRecycling is an initiative aimed at building low-cost waste collection infrastructure while raising general awareness on the importance of recycling for environmental sustainability and social welfare.
According to Adebiyi-Abiola, Nigerians should see waste as a resource, not a nuisance or an environmental problem. She added that the current attitude towards waste can be traced to issues of diseases and infections.

“We came up with the #LagosIsRecycling ‎campaign because we wanted a system that would position waste as a solution instead of a problem in our society,“ said Adebiyi-Abiola. “With this initiative, Wecyclers in partnership with Lagos State Waste Management (LAWMA) is encouraging Nigerians to recycle their household items thereby promoting a cleaner and healthier Lagos.”
Other partner organizations in the #LagosIsRecycling initiative include Unilever, DHL, Nigerian Bottling Company, UKAID, and FCMB.
To recycle your waste via Wecyclers #LagosIsRecycling initiative, simply take a picture of the items you plan to recycle and post on social media using the hashtag #LagosIsRecycling and the Wecyclers team will reach out to you.
You will be rewarded with redeemable points based on the volume and quality of recyclables you provide.
