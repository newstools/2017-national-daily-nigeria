The Human rights lawyer noted that section 66 of the Nigerian 1999 constitution (as amended ) which state inter alia that “a person shall be unworthy to make laws for the country once he had been indicted”.
“Many of them are not only indicted but standing trials for various misdemeanors, yet want to make laws for us to obey. We won’t take it
“They can’t be allowed to make laws for us, though they cleared themselves but in our view they are not, we are poise to take back our country.
The group made six demands,”we demand resignation of the senators already indicted.
“Pay cut: Salaries and allowance, immediate passage of 2017 National budget without further delay, pass bill to establish special courts for financial crimes, the whistles blowers protection bills lying fallow in their chamber, the executive must also ensure that the country experience true federalism.
