Few months after the collapse of the Russian online ponzi scheme (MMM), two agents identified as Debora Fojo and Musa Garba were on Friday arraigned at the Malumfashi Chief Magistrates’ Court in Katsina State for stealing, cheating, and breach of trust.

National Daily learnt that the duo had collected N429, 000 from two investors but failed to invest the money in the online business scheme.

A police source revealed that Fojo allegedly collected N229, 000 from one Sani Salisu of Unguwar Sodangi in Malumfashi to invest in the scheme, while Garba, collected N200, 000 from one Adamu Aliyu of Gangarawa also in Malumfashi to invest in MMM.

Both accused who are residents of Government Girls Secondary School Malumfashi Quarters and Unguwar Danyawa village in Kafur local government area respectively, pleaded not guilty to the charges.

According to the Police Prosecutor, Inspector Sani Ahmed, said the accused deceived the complainants with a bogus return on investment of 30 percent within 30 days of investment.
