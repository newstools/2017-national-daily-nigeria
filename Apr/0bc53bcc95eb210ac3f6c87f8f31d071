“Gross earnings growth was driven by a combination of increased yields on earning assets and an absolute growth in the volume of earning assets which led to a 24.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in interest income” he said.
The Fidelity Bank helmsman also spoke about the impact of the bank’s efforts at reducing operating cost. “Our cost optimization initiatives continued to deliver cost savings as total operating expenses declined y-o-y by 10.4% to N14.4 billion, this was driven by a decline in over 60% of our operating expense lines in Q1 2017. We will continue to optimize our cost profile without impacting service delivery through the disciplined execution of the initiatives from our recently completed business optimization project” he explained further.
Deposits, which is a measure of customer confidence, in the period under review, grew quarter on quarter (q-on-q) by 0.9% to N800bn in March 2017 from N793bn as at December 2016, with low cost deposits accounting for 79.4% of Total deposits.
