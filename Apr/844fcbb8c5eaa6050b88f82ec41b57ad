The World Bank also indicated that Nigeria had $5.94bn that had not been disbursed. It defined undisbursed credit as the amount of the loan/credit/grant, calculated in United States dollars equivalent on the date of the summary that was still available to be drawn down.

Some conditions are usually fulfilled before the bank allows a drawdown on already approved loans. Such conditions usually include milestones reached with already approved and drawn down facilities.
With a total of $6.16bn of the total loans already repaid by the country, the World Bank put Nigeria’s current obligation to it at $6.79bn. A total of $16,826,750.56 was repaid to third parties.
The bank defined borrower obligation as the outstanding balance for a loan as of the end of a period in US dollars equivalent. The borrower’s obligation includes the amounts outstanding due to third parties.
