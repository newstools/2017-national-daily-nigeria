ask landlords to evict them from houses

By OKOSUN DENNIS
After several atrocious acts committed by Fulani herdsmen against the people of Ewu, in Esan land, especially raping their women in the farm, the Kingdom has ban Fulani people in the entire community.
In actualisation of the directives, every landlord and lady has been mandated to evict any Fulani person living in his or her house with immediate effect.
National Daily learnt that the present action became necessary following the raping and murdering of two women by the Fulani herdsmen recently.
An Ewu resident, who spoke anonymously told our reporter that “Landlords/Landladies have been directed to evict Hausa/Fulani people living in their houses. No more cattle market, cattle rearing and cattle grazing in Ewu.
“The decision was unanimously reached by the people of Ewu kingdom after series of meetings by all communities that make up Ewu kingdom after the herdsmen raped and slaughtered two women in the farm at Ewu, Esan Central Local Government of Edo state recently.

National Daily also gathered that the reason for taken the decision was based on constant raping of “our wives, sisters and mothers;” killing our people; destroying our farmlands and farms; and robbing our people.”
It was further gathered that they engage in kidnapping of people for ransom; posing as security threat and disguising as herdsmen whereas they are terrorists.
National Daily recalls that the notoriety of Fulani herdsmen is so much that farmers have abandoned their farms for fear of been killed.
It was also gathered that they have attacked people at Ekpoma, Urohi, Ukhun, Igbeuben and Ugbegun and other surrounding villages.
