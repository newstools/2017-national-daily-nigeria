The 21 days ultimatum lapsed on 18th April 2017.  The congress reviewed the issues that led to the ultimatum and demands of the association which were yet to be met by the hospital management and noted that patient care, training and staff welfare ‎ continue to suffer as these demands have not met.

The congress discussed exhaustively the promises offered by the hospital management that the demands of the association will be met soonest and the UBTH patient and staff will have cause to smile. ‎The Emergency General meeting also reviewed the genuine intervention of well-meaning personalities from Edo State as well as retired senior doctors who pleaded to the association to delay the intended industrial action.
After reviewing all the issues the congress has shifted the ultimatum by fourteen days to allow time for the hospital management to meet her promises and allow more time for well-meaning Nigerians to insist that patient care and staff welfare in UBTH should be prioritized. The Ultimatum was extended by 14 days to elapse on May 4 by which if management are not forthcoming on their promises the doctors vowed to commence the much dreaded industrial action.
