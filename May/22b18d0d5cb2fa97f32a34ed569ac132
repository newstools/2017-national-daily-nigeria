Jacobs also urged CBN to create five per cent concessionary interest rate for manufacturers to drive the nation’s diversification agenda and increase contribution to the Gross Domestic Product.

Jacobs said that with concessionary interest rate, manufacturers would be able to expand their businesses, create wealth, boost productivity and catalyse economic transformation.
As the MPC commences its quarterly meeting today, on Monday, May 22 and Tuesday, May 23, 2017, watchers are expectant to see what new measures and rates the MPC plans to unfold in its goal of ensuring stability in the financial system.
