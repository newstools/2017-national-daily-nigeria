The Ponderosity to make United Kingdom Great again is a Gem hidden inside Theresa May. — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas
Politics Is No Sentiment; In graciousness we the People of United Kingdom and her Great Britain must accept Theresa May leadership, so we can defeat European Union Illogical Policies and False Intrusion in the UK Territories.
Every Nation can Sustain on their Own. We know the Truth, Our Future, Hope and Existence in the Age of Nuclear Weapon a Destruction of Humanity, if we do not let the British Eagle Theresa May Turbine the Power of British Politics. — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas
Prime Minister Theresa May is Today Leader, and Tomorrow, her hand of Time will Strengthen the Future of United Kingdom Weakness and Fears. — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas
The Opposition Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corby has no Ideology. All He talks about is Manifesto, promising to give the People what you don’t have is an arrogant attraction of Illusional Delusion.
You cannot promise People what they own. To promise to spend British Money on British People is not a reason to be Voted as such Concept is Ignorance in Mockery.
HER KNOWLEDGEABLE PROFESSOR ALEXIA THOMAS WARNS MR. CORBYN
— Mr. Jeremy Corbyn stop Talking Nonsense. Take a Bath and take a Sleep and let the Iron Lady Theresa May take United Kingdom to her 21st Century Greatness.
Do you have £10,000,000,000.00 (£10 Billion)? No.
Where will you get it from, steal from the Economy?
You know you are Weak, You know you are Tired, You know you have no Capacity and You fully know you are Traumatized, Fearful and Disoriented because the Labour Party is a Divided House. I advise you not to drawn United Kingdom in a Shallow Pond.
Politics is not Promises or Pledges, but is Ideology of Genius in Concept of Creative Invention of Men with qualities. — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas
Politics is Hybrid Concept of your Will of Change; The Wheel of Change in 21st Century is British Myth and Power to Rule the World again. — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas
Politics to promise Allocation, Budget and Budgetary is the Greatest Deceit of 19th Century Politicians of Masters of Grain for Ruin at Drain that hindered 21st Century Greatness. Men who speak Vain Words are lost in Illusion. — By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas
— I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas, say to you Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, you must now stop the Brainwash of the British People, stop promising Money and Expenditure in a Calculous exploitation of Mindery Fallacy. This does not mean you are  defeated nor is your contribution not important. The British Politics has recognized your doggedness and you are equally a true gem with interest to serve Motherland in Sincerity.
— I, Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas, say to you Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, ‘The Battle of Authority is not Emotions and to embrace your weakness will mean we the British People be ready to Die the Death’ of Shame’, so in Ponderosity I say Please stop, give Theresa May the Podium, it’s her Voice We need to hear. She speaks Ideology and you talk Vain.
Our British Republic will not play Fools to eccentric Politicians with Fallatical Manifestoes meant for Fools Republic. So, British and Commonwealth People our 21st Century United Kingdom Political Podium is not Jeremy Corbyn’s Playground.
The Media should stop Showcasing Labour Party in their Stream as this is a premeditated attempt to manipulate the British Peoples Views.
WE ALL MUST NOW REASON UK ELECTION 2017!!!
IF WE NEED FOOLS POLITICS OF DECEIT AND LIES, THEN YOU VOTE LABOUR. 
IF WE NEED WISE POLITICS, THEN VOTE CONSERVATIVE FOR TRUTH, LIFE AND JUSTICE. 
Press Release By Her Knowledgeable Professor Alexia Thomas – Chairman of The Commonwealth Liberation Party and Chieftain of The Commonwealth Treaty Alliance Commission.
