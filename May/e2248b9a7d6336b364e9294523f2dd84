National Daily gathered that the security man, who was stationed at the ETF Lecture Theatre were students were having their examinations, went to a nearby ditch along the university’s Gate 5 – leading to Mairi, a sprawling university settlement to urinate.
Unknown to the security guard, he never knew that the suicide bomber was hidden inside a nearby ditch perfecting plans on how to reach the lecture theatre and wreak maximum havoc.
It was further learnt that on sighting the security guard and seeing how he ‘gallantly jumped into the pitch to challenge him’, the bomber panicked and detonated the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) strapped on him and died immediately.
