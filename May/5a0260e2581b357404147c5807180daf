Med-View Airline, on Thursday, clarified the European Union operational restriction, which the public has misunderstood as a total ban on its UK operations.

The airline said its operations to London is in no way affected by the ban and had since being operating with her wet-leased aircraft. The ban which falls under exception rule in EASA, Annex A, where it states that “Air carrier listed in Annex A could be permitted to exercise traffic rights by using wet-leased aircraft of an air carrier, which is not subject to an operating ban.”

The Airline regretted the anxiety the misinformation may have caused its teeming passengers and assured them that there is no basis for alarm as the Lagos-London flight remains unaffected.

“We at Med-View Airline are committed to safety, and currently working with EASA and NCAA to restore normalcy,” the statement said.
