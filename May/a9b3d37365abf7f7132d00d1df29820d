Bj foundation was trailing Dynamite force 2-3 in the semi finals of the Edo state federation cup before the game was abandoned .
The proprietor of Bj foundation Douglas Idahosa told National Daily that his team was attacked because his players was protesting against what they saw as a controversial goal.
Idahosa added that they came from behind to lead Dynamite force 2-1 before the referee gave our opponent clear offside goals.” The second goal was unbelievable  it was obviously offside.”
Douglas explained that his players was protesting peacefully against the goal before a player of Dynamite force attack my player. More than three of my players were seriously injured. They have them on picture.
According to a reliable source who told our reporter that Bj foundation players attacked the centre refeeree first, before the other team
In the other hand ,the chairman of Dynamite force Bernard Joman refute the claims arguing that it was a player of Bj foundation who attacked the center referee.
Joman also revealed that is not true. It was a player of Bj foundation who attacked the match official after we scored the third goal.”
 
“Our goal came when we did a couple of changes to heighten our game plan, thus the result came.”
It may interest you to know that similar situation occurred in the 2016 semi finals of the Edo state FA cup when Dynamite force defeat Bj foundation 2-1.
The Edo FA is taking the lead in football leadership at the moment and many are watching what the Frank illaboya lead board is going to come out with to stop this ugly situation
