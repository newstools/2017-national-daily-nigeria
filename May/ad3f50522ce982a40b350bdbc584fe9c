No fewer than 36 people were on Saturday feared dead as two  buses collided and caught fire at a  Km 96 on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.

According to a witness, the two 18-seater buses had a head-on collision and the buses caught fire immediately.

“All the passengers in the two buses were burnt beyond recognition.

“Only a baby escaped death because the 
father of the child threw him out through the window of the bus,’’ the witness said.
