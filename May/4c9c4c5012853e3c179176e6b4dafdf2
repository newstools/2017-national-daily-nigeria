Youths angry over governor’s silence

From OSEMWENGIE BEN OGBEMUDIA, Benin City

Youths have gone on wild rampage in Ewu, Edo State, demanding justice for the killing of two women in the farm by suspected Fulani herdsmen.

That has fueled the mass action in which Youths of Ewu community, Esan Central Local Government Area, Edo State, have sustained their vehement protesting on the Ewu axis of the Benin – Auchi – Abuja, over the killing of a 61 year old woman, Martina Emoyon, in her farm by suspected Fulani herdsmen and another middle-aged woman.

Our Report revealed that one person was allegedly shot by the military during the peaceful protest, which further sparked off a more aggressive riot.

Motorist moving towards that direction from Abuja or Benin may not find that route passable because traffic has been obstructed by the protesting youths. 

Therefore, motorists may have to seek for alternative routes as the area has been condoned off by security agents.

The protesters are calling for justice, saying the perpetrators must be brought to book.

The youths are also angry that the governor of Edo State has not made official statement over the murder of these women.

The provocation of the youths is heightened because the Fulani herdsmen had threatened that they will carry out the nefarious act, and they have made good their threat.
