The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said it recorded 1.7 million candidates in the sale of application forms for the 2017 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME.
Fabian Benjamin, Head of Media and Publicity, JAMB, announced the development during the weekend. He said the number of applicants is the highest that has been recorded in 39 years.
In a statement released after the Board’s emergency meeting in Jos, JAMB urged Nigerians to trust its processes as they were meant to enhance productivity, eliminate examination malpractice and promote transparency.
“We registered a number that has never been done in the entire 39 years of the existence of JAMB within a time frame; the highest we have ever had was 1.5 million.

Nigerians were skeptical; we looked at the system and made adjustments where necessary to ensure a full proof process of registration and examination. We are always sure of our systems and will continue to expand our frontiers of thinking to transform the Board to an agency that Nigerians will be proud of.
“JAMB wishes to state clearly that it will continue to be open in all its activities and ensure inclusiveness even in the areas of its finances, the statement read in part.
While urging for support from Nigerians, the board announced that the sales of application forms are closed and examination will commence on May 13, 2017.
