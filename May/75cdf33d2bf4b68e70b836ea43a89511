Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has confirmed the rumour making the rounds that the Vehicle Inspection officers are to stare clear off the Lagos roads,citing the fact that they are the main cause of gridlocks on the roads and that technology will be used to cater for vehicle registration and other functions of the VIO’s .
Ambode made the disclosure yesteray while officially commissioning the pedestrian bridges, laybys and slip roads at Ojodu Berger, he unequivocally declared banishment of the VIOs on Lagos roads.
The VIO’s will no longer be visible on the roads as CCTV cameras and electronic gadgets are already available there to capture footages and clipse of defaulters,for adequate penalty and punishment to be served on offenders.
Pundits are however of the view that people’s mindset need be reorientated as regards owning the infrastructures being put in place by the government.
