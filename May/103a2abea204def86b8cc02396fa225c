For the second day, the prosecution failed to produce exhibits in the trial of Supreme Court Justice Sylvester Ngwuta, thereby stalling the trial at the Federal High Court, Abuja on Wednesday.

Ngwuta is standing trial on an amended 13-count charge of corruption related offences, bordering on money laundering and other financial crimes.

Prosecuting counsel O. O. Fatunde had on May 16 pleaded with the court to adjourn the 
matter to enable him present the exhibits in the next adjourned date.

And on Wednesday, the exhibits have yet to arrive—for unknown reasons.

“It is not our intention to waste the time of the court and the defence, we are asking for a short date convenient for the court to come and continue with the trial,” she said at the resumed hearing.

SAN Kanu Agabi, the counsel to Ngwuta, did not oppose the application.

He however stated that the defendant is more anxious to defend himself than the prosecution is to prosecute him.

Presiding Justice John Tosho adjourned the matter until May 25 and 26 for continuation of hearing.
