Despite reports that President Muhammadu Buhari resumed duty on Tuesday, National Daily gathered that the President was absent at the federal Executive council meeting this Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.

Findings from Aso Rock Villa, Abuja, this Wednesday, indicated that for the third time consecutively, President Buhari has been absent at Federal Executive Council meeting for the obvious reasons of ill-health. The Presidency has, however, persistently assured Nigerians and the international community that there is no cause for alarm over the health of President Buhari.

Meanwhile, President Buhari was gathered to have returned to work on Tuesday; the same day, he was said to have held separate meetings with the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and the Group Managing Director (GMD), of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikati Baru.
