There seems to be respite for operators and visitors to Nigeria seaports at Apapa, Lagos, as Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Dangote Group of Companies and Flour Mills are teaming up to raise N4.3 billion to repair the roads.

The Managing Director of NPA, Hadiza Usman, who made this known in a meeting with stakeholders stated that NPA would provide N1.8 billion while Dangote Group and Flour Mills would provide N2.5 billion.

According to him, the meeting was convened as part of last minute efforts to stop seaport operators from embarking on strike.

“We have received proposal for Corporate Social Responsibility of N2.5 billion from Dangote Group and Flour Mills for the full reconstruction of port roads.

“The reconstruction entails full drainage service and the total cost of the Apapa port access roads project is N4.3 billion.”

In addition, Usman stated that “The two entities are willing to provide N2.5 billion, while NPA will pay the remaining N1.8 billion to ensure that the roads are done.

“We are reengineering the roads for business to thrive, we just need to get it done. This is critical to us”.

In the main time, the MD said immediate palliatives would be carried out on the roads whilst the main project of reconstructing the roads would follow accordingly.

Further, she stated that the construction would cover a length of 12 metres with full utilities in the area of drainage for a life span of 30 years pointing out that the construction would last for 10 months. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) would be signed by all parties within a forth night for construction to commence.
