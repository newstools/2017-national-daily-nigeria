She further stated that OLX is also excited to be helping the Ministries and  Government agencies sell their unused personal items.
Last year, OLX revised the online classified model by launching a premium service named Do-It-For-Me (D.I.F.M). D.I.F.M helps busy executives with the helps of the OLX Champs who are sales experts sell their items.They handle posting the item on the site, taking calls from buyers, negotiating for the right price and closing the deal.
