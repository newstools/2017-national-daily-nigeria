The students had earlier taken to the streets of Ibadan in protest, alleging insensitivity on the part of the university management.
But the university’s Director of Communications and Publication, Olatunji Oladejo, said that the closure became necessary in other to avert crisis.
He said that the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, had convened an emergency meeting of the university Senate to review the circumstances surrounding the development.
“The University of Ibadan in its wisdom has decided to shift the examination earlier scheduled for June to July, 2017,” Oladejo said.
