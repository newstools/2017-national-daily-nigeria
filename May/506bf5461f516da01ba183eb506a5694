Former National Security Adviser Sambo Dasuki may stay longer in detention no matter what courts say because there are other charges for which he hasn’t got bail.

President Muhammadu Buhari media aide Sheu Garba told State House Correspondent on Tuesday while explaining successes te APC government has made so far.

Besides that, security agencies are still conducting investigations on some allegations against the ex-NSA which necessitates his continued detention.

For the leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, IMN, Ibrahim Zakzaky, the government os keeping him in detention to save his neck.

Shehu said the government is anxious over the possibility of a breakdown of law and order Zakzaky is let loose.

“Government has a responsibility to ensure his safety,” Garba said, adding he is not in a prison type of detention. He is in the company of his wife and children voluntarily.

“Government is being compassionate on this matter. There is an overall public good that government is looking at in this matter,” he said.

Zakyzaky was arrested January 2016 when his sect obstructed the passage of COAS Gen Tukur Buratai along a highway in Zaria, leading to a clash between the army and the brotherhood.
