A week to the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination, JAMB on Saturday advised candidates for Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) not to panic over the delay in getting their examination centres.
The Head of Media and Information of the board, Dr Fabian Benjamin, revealed that candidates would have all their examination details communicated to them before the exam date.
Benjamin said although the crosschecking of prospective candidates data would end by 9p.m on Saturday none of them has been given examination centre.
He said, “Candidates are just concluding their registrations, so no one has received centre for the examination starting from May 13.

“Hopefully by next week they will start getting their centres, so there is no cause for worry,” he said.
He admonished candidates to always check their emails for further updates.
National Daily recalls that the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board said it had so far registered more than 1.7 million candidates for the 2017 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination across the country.
It further added that about 633 exam centres with facilities will be used during the examination.
