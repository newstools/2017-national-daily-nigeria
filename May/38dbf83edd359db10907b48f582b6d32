The executive governor of Ekiti state governor Ayodele Fayose as described the senior prophet of Liberation City Worldwide, Dr. Chris Okafor as a true man of God, sent by God to set the captives free.
 
Speaking at the final day of a two day prophetic crusade with the theme ‘Season of Settlement’ at the state pavilion in Ado Ekiti, the number one man of the state said, his government can provide roads, water health care facility and the rest but the state cannot provide spiritual deliverance.
 
He said God gave that power to the chosen one like Dr. Chris Okafor, so the state appreciate the coming of God’s oracle to the state. Governor Fayose enjoyed all other man of God to emulate the spiritual opportunity God gave them by bailing people out from their spiritual bondage.
 
In the sermon delivered by Dr. Chris Okafor, the man of God said lots of family are afflicted because they are ignorant.  While praying for the State, Dr. Okafor said of one of the major way to break out of family affliction is to raise altar for altar.
 
He also prayed for the governor, also imploring the citizens to continue to support and be law abiding in other to take the state to greater heights.
 
Highlight of the crusade was the prophetic move of the Holy Spirit where the Prophet Prophesized into the lives of the congregation.  Aside from many giving their lives to Jesus, several others also surrendered charms and various fetish objects at the crusade ground.
 
Also, several people were delivered from long suffering sicknesses and bondages.
 
Lot of people regain their sight. A mental derail man too was delivered from madness totally. The Chris Okafor world outreach ministries continues it crusade in Ibadan, Oyo state capital from 11th to the 12th of May 2017.
