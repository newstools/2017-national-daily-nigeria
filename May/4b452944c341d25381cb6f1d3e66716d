Stocks trading on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange hit a three-month high on Tuesday, lifted by company earnings results that outperformed market expectations and hopes that a new currency-trading window will help lure investors back to Africa’s biggest economy, analysts said.
The market all share index rose 0.77 percent to 25,965 points, led higher by banking and oil stocks.
In a client briefing note, Vetiva Capital noted corporate results were better than expected and said it anticipated increased demand for Nigerian stocks this week.
