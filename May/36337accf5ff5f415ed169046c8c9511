According to the letter prepared by her attorneys, the 500Million is to ‘repair’ the damages caused by the defamatory publications and statement. Meanwhile, the actress’ husband, Lanre Gentry, who was released after fulfilling his bail condition has accused the Nigerian government of neglecting those in prison and focusing on other things. The Hotelier was remanded in Kirikiri prisons on Tuesday, May 9, after he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his Nollywood actress wife. Gentry was arraigned at an Ogba Magistrate Court 1 sitting at Ogba, Ikeja, on three count charges under the State Criminal law 2011. Gentry was subsequently slammed with a restraining order that keeps him no less than one mile of Mercy Aigbe’s location at all times. The couple was married for seven years and share a son together.
