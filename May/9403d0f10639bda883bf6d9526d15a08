She was said to have already confessed to the police while efforts were already being made to rescue the children and arrest the buyers.

It was reported that the woman was able to carry out the illegal sales without her husband’s knowledge because the husband, who rented an apartment in Idimu area of Alimosho local government, works outside Lagos, where he stays during the week and returns home weekend or monthly.

It was gathered that the woman told her husband that she took the kids to her relatives to cover her tracks.

The woman is still in detention while the police are carrying out investigations to locate the whereabouts of the children.
