Nigeria’s stock index rose to its highest level in 10 months on Friday, lifted by gains in the banking sector as overnight lending rates eased after central bank cash injections into the banking system.
The index rose by 2.1 percent to 29,064 points on Friday, its highest level since July last year, lifted in particular by gains in First Bank Holdings, which rose the maximum 10 percent.
The rally has helped pushed the index above 29,000, a milestone for investors, and erased year-to-date losses. Over the course of 2016, stocks fell 6.2 percent.
Other gainers include pan-African banking group Ecobank, up 5 percent, while Guaranty Trust Bank was up 5 percent, Zenith Bank gained 4.99 percent and Dangote Cement rose 2.33 percent.
Overnight placement dropped to around 12.5 percent on Friday from 26 percent last week as banking system liquidity rose. That was spurred by the government distributing roughly N200 billion ($657.03 million) in budget allocations to states. The central bank also refunded 131 billion naira in matured treasury bills to lenders.
