The special prayers were jointly led  by the Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Dass Branch, Reverend Kefas Galadima and Sheikh Hamza Dass at the instance of the Speaker, during the Flagging Off ceremony of Road projects in Bogoro, Dass, Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency, held in Dass, Bauchi State.


The Speaker used the occasion to enjoin the people to put the leadership of the country in their daily prayers for God’s guidance and protection.



“Please, as you have been told and you know, Mr. President has health challenges. Pray for him. Pray for the leadership of this country, pray for the vice president, pray for the governors, even when they are not doing well, that God will give them the wisdom to improve. Pray for local government chairmen, even though they have run away, they don’t want development. Pray for them so that they will see themselves to be working for the people.”
