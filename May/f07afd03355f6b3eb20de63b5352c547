Sanity seems to have been thrown to the dust bin as a 25-year-old woman, Sandra Ishaku, was charged to a Jos Upper Area Court on Tuesday for allegedly selling her four-month-old baby for N100,000.
Ishaku, was said to have conspired with three others identified as Amechi Emmanuel,  Jones Osim and Gladys Chukwuma to commit the act.
It was gathered that the accused were charged with conspiracy, cruelty, and child abandonment.
The prosecutor, Mr L. O. Ocho, said Ishaku, had on May 10, 2017, sold her baby to Chukwuma, for N100,000.
National Daily learnt that the transaction was carried out in a law chambers owed by Osim, a legal practitioner in Jos.
“Ishaku conspired with Emmanuel and sold her baby to Chukwuma, who had just relocated from Ebonyi State to Jos,” he said.
The Presiding Judge, Yahaya Mohammed, did not take the plea of the accused, opting to remand three of them – Ishaku, Emmanuel and Chukwuma – in prison custody, while the matter was adjourned to June 1, when hearing would commence.
Mohammed, however, granted Osim bail after his counsel, Mr Lawrence Anya, pleaded that he be released on bail to the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Plateau State Chapter.
A similar appeal by Mr Peter Ikeolu, counsel to the three others, had earlier been rejected after the prosecutor argued that freeing them would affect investigation into the matter.
