A trigger-happy operative of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) has shot a medical doctor, who was work bound at the time.
The incident happened last Friday.
According to report, the medical doctor’s car hit a stray dog, which infuriated the law enforcement agent. The operative immediately opened fire on the moving car, but none of its occupant was hit by bullet. After the car stopped, the NSCDC operative moved closer, pulled the medical doctor away before dragging him into the corps van. He was said to have tortured the medical doctor therein before taking him to a hospital.
Desmond Agu, commandant of the NSCDC in Bayelsa, said the affected operative had been arrested while investigation was ongoing.
” … if the officer is found guilty, he will be dealt with according to the provisions of the NSCDC guidelines.”
