The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Olarinde Famous-Cole, has maintained that Imohimi Oluwole Edgal still remains a Commissioner of Police and Acting Commissioner of Police of the Lagos Police Command.

Famous-Cole remarked that, “It is true that the Police Service Commission has the power to appoint and promote Police officers, but all these things have procedures and channels.

We have channels we use in communicating and receiving information or directives. When
CP Imohimi Oluwole Edgal was promoted and appointed as Commissioner of Police and Acting Commissioner of Police Lagos Command, we received an official directive through the appropriate channel, if there will be any changes, it has to come through the appropriate channel as well.

“And until we receive this information through the appropriate channel, it remains a rumour and should be discarded.”

Famous-Cole also noted an online publication that  the Chairman of the Police Service Commission, PSC, Dr. Mike Okiro, disowned the demotion letter contended that, “If the Chairman of the PSC has also denied the knowledge of the said letter which went viral on the internet, then, all these rumours by mischief makers holds no water; it is only effort to tarnish the image of the Nigeria Police Force and by extension the PSC”

Famous-Cole emphasized that, “The CP’s topmost priority is making Lagos the safest place in the world through community policing, and he will not be distracted by mere rumour mongers and mischief makers.”

He appealed that members of the public remain vigilant, urging them not hesitate to inform the Police of any suspicious activities to enable the Command make Lagos State the safest city to reside and do business in Africa through under CP Edgal’s community policing plan.
