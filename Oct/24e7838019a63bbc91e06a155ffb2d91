Kia Motors Corporation announced its September 2017 global sales figures for passenger cars, recreational vehicles (RVs) and commercial vehicles, recording a total of 252,254 units sold.
In September, domestic market sales totaled 48,019 units, representing an increase of 25.4% compared with the same month last year, largely due to the timing difference of the Chuseok holiday, which was in September last year compared to October this year. Overseas sales also increased by 3.6% compared to the previous year, posting 204,235 units.
Kia’s best-selling model in overseas markets during September 2017 was the Sportage compact SUV with 37,746 units sold. The Cerato compact sedan (known as ‘Forte’ or ‘K3’ in some markets) was the second best seller with 28,793 units sold, followed by the subcompact Rio (known as ‘Pride’ in Korea) with 24,760 units sold.
