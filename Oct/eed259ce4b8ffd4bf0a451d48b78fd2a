Super Eagles winger, Ahmed Musa, who plays as a forward for Premier League club, Leicester City, has continued to expand his business empire after he opened his filling station, Myca-7 over the past weekend in the city of Kano.

Musa who was an unused substitute on Saturday as Nigeria qualified for next year’s World Cup in Russia, flew into Kano from Abuja Sunday to commission the filling station.

The Nigeria international has already invested in a sports and fitness center in Kano, which is reportedly worth half a billion Naira, and he also has serious interests in real estate in Abuja, London and Kano.

It was gathered that the football star has built two state-of-the-art Myca-7 filling stations in Kano.
