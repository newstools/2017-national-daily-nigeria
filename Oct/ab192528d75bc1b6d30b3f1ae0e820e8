Reuters revealed that four people had been killed: two bodies were removed from the plane while a further two could be seen in the wreckage.

It was further gathered that 10 people were aboard the plane when Ukrainian-made Antonov crashed.

As rescuers are battling to savage other passengers, it cannot be determined whether they are other survivals apart from the one crew member rescued so far.
