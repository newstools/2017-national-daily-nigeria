The regulatory body made this known in its “Incoming and Outgoing Porting Activities of Mobile Network Operators Report’’ posted on its website.

It said that out of the 34,837 porting activities in August, 17,634 were “Incoming Porting Activities”, while 17,203 were “Outgoing Porting Activities”.
It added that in the outgoing table, 5,328 subscribers moved from MTN Nigeria to other networks through Mobile Number Portability (MNP) in August.
