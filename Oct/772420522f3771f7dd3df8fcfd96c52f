Newly crowned best player of the year, Cristiano Ronaldo, has said that he would have given goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke this year’s FIFA’s Puskas Award, for “the most beautiful goal of the season”.

Olivier Giroud won the prize ahead of Masuluke and Deyna Castellanos, who struck a 94th-minute winner from the centre circle for Venezuela, in the Under-17 Women’s World Cup last October.

“It’s hard to say one, but I have to give credit to the goalkeeper,” Ronaldo said at the awards, which was staged in London on Monday night.

Masuluke, who plays for South African club Baroka FC, came forward to score a spectacular late overhead kick to earn a 1-1 draw against Orlando Pirates last November.

Public voting on the Puskas award winner closed on Monday and the winner was announced at a ceremony in London.
