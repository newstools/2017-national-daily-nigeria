Simona Halep of Romania hits a return during her women’s singles match against Maria Sharapova of Russia at the China Open tennis tournament in Beijing on October 4, 2017.

The world number two was an emphatic 6-2, 6-2 winner to leave five-time Grand Slam champion, Sharapova, still searching for her first title since returning from a doping ban in April.

It was the 26-year-old Halep’s first victory over the Russian in eight meetings.

Sharapova, a former number one now at 104 in the world rankings following her 15-month suspension for taking meldonium, gave an insight into the rollercoaster of emotions in top-level tennis.

“Hard work is not good enough anymore, maybe it was — I don’t know how many years ago — but that’s just not a factor anymore,” said the 30-year-old, asked about comments in a book she recently released.

“The reason I say that is there are some incredible moments, very high moments, and there are very low moments.

“There have been times where I get off the court and you think, I don’t wish this on my future child.

“The feeling is so tough and disappointing.”

Halep, the second seed on Beijing’s outdoor hard courts, is the first woman into the quarter-finals, where she will play either defending champion Agnieszka Radwanska or Daria Kasatkina of Russia.

With world number one Garbine Muguruza exiting in the first round with a virus, Halep is now favourite.

Sharapova said it was the best Halep had played against her — and Halep agreed.

The two met in the first round at the US Open a few weeks ago and Halep said she was delighted to finally taste victory against Sharapova: “I’m really happy that I could do this.

“It’s my first victory against her and I just want to enjoy the moment.”
