An eyewitness, who simply identified himself as Sadiq, said that the incident followed a disagreement over a N50 bribe.

It was the late passenger who offered the police inspector N50 after much disagreement but the police officer insisted it most be N100 before he will let them go.

This  lead to a hot argument and the shooting of the passenger and injuring of another by the Inspector.

But unfortunately for the inspector when he was about to escape the mob attacked him and lynched him.
