Katsina State Police Command says it has arrested a 30-year-old man who specialized in kidnapping rich people for ransom.
Mr Beson Gwama, the new Commissioner of Police in the state, told newsmen on Monday in Katsina that the suspect was a leader of a kidnap syndicate whose operations had created fears among the people in the area.
“We arrested the suspect while attempting to kidnap the manager of a filling station who is the son of a business mogul in the state.
“The ring leader came to the filling station with a fake policeman who abducted the son of the businessman to an unknown destination and later demanded for ransom. “Luck, however, ran against them when the kidnapped victim escaped from his captors and returned home.

“The kidnapping expert was arrested while attempting to escape with the ransom that the victim’s parents paid at a scene outside Malumfashi town but his two accomplices managed to escape,” he said.
Gwana appealed to members of the public to always assist the police with useful information about the activities of criminals in the state.
