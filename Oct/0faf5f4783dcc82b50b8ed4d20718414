An Ebute Metta Chief Magistrate’s Court on Thursday remanded two men; Nduka Okafor and James Aikhionbare for allegedly stabbing a woman to death in Lagos.
The duo, Okafor, 62, and Aikhionbare, 38, were brought before the Magistrate, Mrs A.S. Okubule, on a two-count charge of conspiracy and murder.
Okubule said that the accused should be remanded at the Ikoyi Prisons, pending an advice from the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions.

National Daily gathered that the accused persons committed the offence on August 17, 2016 at House J68B, Close 9, Victoria Garden City, Lekki, Lagbos.
The counsel, Mr Goddey Osuyi, from the Panti Police Station told court that the accused conspired to stab one Mrs Mabel Okafor to death at her residence.
An offence, it was further learnt, contravened Sections 223 and 233 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The Magistrate, Okubule, therefore adjourned the case to November 20.
