Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN) has expressed concern over the quit notice and cancellation of Intels Nigeria Limited Vessel Pilotage Service by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA).
It warned that the development may lead to loss of over 11,000 direct and indirect jobs.
A statement signed by its President-General, Comrade Adewale Adeyanju, said most of these employees are Nigerians with families and responsibilities.

The union said the socio-economic implications of most of losing their jobs in a volatile area like Rivers State can be better imagined than experienced.
“As organised labour, our utmost concern is job security and welfare of our members in Intels Nigeria Limited.
Today, we are aware that Intels has under its employment over 5000 direct employees and over 6000 indirect employees bringing the number of
employees to over 11,000.
