The Peoples Democratic Party has said it was not surprised by the Federal Government’s controversial decision to reinstate Maina.

The opposition party said Maina had been paid N22 million in salary arrears by the President Muhammadu Buhari government.

PDP’s position was contained in a statement signed by its spokesman, Dayo Adeyeye, in 
Abuja on Monday.

According to him, Nigerians had expected Maina to be arrested not reinstated.

Launching into the back story of Maina’s fraud in the pension reform office, Adeyeye said the party is worried that the APC administration seem to have grown thick skins to constructive criticism.

“It is reported that the fugitive has been rewarded with payment of bogus salary arrears amounting to N22m, which he has reportedly collected upon approval and released by the Accountant General of the Federation. We dare the government of the day to deny this with verifiable evidence.”

The party equally demanded the immediate sacking of the Minister of Interior and the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice for complicity in Maina’s journey back into the system.
