For stealing in the house of God, a 27-year-old driver, Ishaq Bala, was on Tuesday jailed for two years by a Mararaba Grade 1 Area Court in Nasarawa State.


It was learnt that the convict had broken into Cocin Church, Base 4, Aku Village, Mararaba, and made away with a set of drum and iron rods.

National Daily gathered that Bala, who also resides at Mararaba, was found guilty in all the three-count charge of criminal conspiracy, housebreaking and theft brought against him.

The Judge, Mr Albert Maga, held that the police prosecutor, Agabi Auta, had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt leading to the conviction of the defendant.





“He is hereby sentenced to two years imprisonment for the three-count charge,” he said.

However, the judge, Maga, offered Bala N10,000 option of fine, with warning him to desist from committing crime.

Earlier, the Police Prosecutor Agabi Auta told the court that Pastor Habila Dasat of Cocin Church, Base 4, Aku Village, Mararaba, had lodged a complaint against the accused on August 15 at`A’ Divisional Police Station.

Auta alleged that the accused with three others, now at large, broke into the church through the fence and stole a set of drums and some iron rods.

“The security guard was able to get hold of the accused, while others ran away but the stolen items were recovered from him.”

The prosecutor said the offences contravened Sections 97, 288 and 347 of the Penal Code.
