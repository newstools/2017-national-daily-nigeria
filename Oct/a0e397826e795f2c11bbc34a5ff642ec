Malam Musa Mohammed, a 43-year-old father, has been arrested in Niger for setting his 15-year-old son, Bello Musa, ablaze for alleged frequent quarrels with his elder brother.


The Director-General, Rights Protection Agency, Mrs Mairam Kolo,  announces this in Minna on Tuesday.

It was learnt that the incident occurred around Polytechnic Road, Bida, in Bida Local Government Area of the state.

Musa was said to have tied the son’s leg, bath him with patrol he got from his motorbike and set him on fire.

However, the victim was rescued by neighbours who rushed to his aid after he shouted for help.

Mrs Kolo further explained that “During interrogation, the father confessed that his action was as a result of the behaviour of the boy, that he is always quarrelling with his elder brother and rude to him.

“He said that he was tired of the boy’s bad behaviour and had warned him several times to stop fighting his elder brother, but he refused to adhere to the warning,” she reiterated.

The DG added that the accused would be charge to court under Section 25 of the Child Rights Law and sections 299 and 348 of the Panel Code Law.

Meanwhile, the victim has been admitted at Umaru Ndayako General Hospital, Bida where he is receiving treatment.

The father, however, pleaded with the agency for leniency, noting that he was provoked to do what he did.
