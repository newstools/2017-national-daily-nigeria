Neymar  has asked UEFA to expel Barcelona from the Champions League after failing to honour a £23million loyalty payment, according to reports in Spain.

National Daily believe the Brazilian star was advised by his lawyers to take the extreme action.

Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain from Barca in a world-record shattering £198million deal this summer, clearly on bad terms.

However, despite the player’s plea, Uefa were reportedly quick to snub the Brazil forward’s request.

Meanwhile, director at the La Liga giants, Raul Sanllehi, has officially left the club.

Sanllehi played a vital role in bringing Neymar to Spain four years ago, but has now left.

Spanish newspaper Marca claim he has done so “on his own volition” but was “upset and frustrated” when Neymar stormed out of the Nou Camp.

Big-spending PSG also face a Champions League dilemma of their own, according to El Pais.

The Spanish outlet claim the Ligue 1 giants may be forced to sell eight players or face expulsion from Europe’s elite competition over breach of Financial Fair Play regulations.

Angel Di Maria, Javier Pastore, Blaise Matuidi, Lucas Moura, Julian Draxler, Hatem Ben Arfa and Thiago Silva are now expected to leave in January.
