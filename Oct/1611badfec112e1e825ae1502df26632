The Securities and Exchange Commission has announced plans to join the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and other capital market regulators across the globe to celebrate the 2017 edition of the IOSCO World Investor Week, which is a first of its kind from 2nd through 8th October 2017.


The Investor Week (WIW) is a week-long, global campaign for IOSCO to raise awareness about the importance of investor education and protection and highlight the various initiatives of securities regulators in these two critical areas.


IOSCO securities regulators across the globe will, among others, provide a variety of activities, including launching investor-focused communications and services, promoting contests to increase awareness of investor education initiatives, organizing workshops and conferences, and conducting local/national campaigns in their own jurisdictions.

On its part, SEC Nigeria, under the leadership of Mounir Gwarzo, has lined up a series of investor based activities targeted at investors, market women, artisans, students and the general public.
