The Senate has urged the Federal Ministry of Education to scrap post-Unified Matriculation Examination (UME) in its entirety.

It has also urged the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to develop a strategy to ensure the efficiency and integrity in the conduct of the pre-university examination.

The decision of the Senate, followed the adoption of a motion sponsored by Umaru Kurfi, on Tuesday.
