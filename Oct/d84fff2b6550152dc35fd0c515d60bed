The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned the hearing of a suit filed by former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki, till January 25, 2018.
Dasuki is challenging his continued detention for alleged involvement in the sharing of $2billion arms procurement funds during ex-President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration.

He was also accused of awarding phantom contracts for the purchase of helicopters, fighter jets, and ammunition meant for military campaign against the Boko Haram sect.
The ex-NSA was arrested by the Department of State Service (DSS) on December 1, 2015 and has been in detention since that time.
