A team of Nigeria-based programmers lead by Timi Ajiboye have launched dedicated Bitcoin exchange for Africa. 
The exchange service is named Bitkoin. Africa and seeks to provide legitimate trading opportunities for local cryptocurrency holders. The platform boasts an automated escrow service and the ability to buy Bitcoin using Visa and MasterCard, claims Ajiboye.
The service, launched at the weekend, has complete support for Nigeria and partial (buying only) support for all other countries.
