The chances of the opposition’s Peoples’ Democratic Party of winning the 2019 Presidential election are only hinged on the South-West zone producing the National Chairman slot of the party.

Goodluck Jonathan Campaign ex-DG Femi Fani-kayode said this while speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today.

He is worried the region has never occupied the seat.

“There was an agreement they would go to the South-West. Some were of the view that agreement no longer binds anybody, and others believe it should remain in the South-West. I believe strongly that it should remain in the South-West for a number of reasons,” he said.

According to him,  if the PDP is really serious about winning the election in 2019, a southwesterner as  chairman will be in order.

“ I am happy to say that the Northern caucus of the party appears to share that view that it should be in the South-West simply because we have never had it before since the inception of the PDP,” he said.

“We have never had a National Chairman from the South-West and we need the numbers when it comes to an election but we will resolve this issue well before the convention. There will be a consensus and we will move forward together as one.”

Among the southersterners gunning for the topmost seat in the party are Bode George, a national vice chairman; former Gov. Gbenga Danie; Prof Femi Adeniran; and others.
