Rivers Gov. Nyesom Wike has called on Nigerians to disregard the vice presidential posters all over Abuja by a faceless group pushing him to contest.

He described it as the handwork of mischief makers.

In a statement signed by Simeon Nwakaudu, Special Assistant to the Rivers State Governor on Electronic Media, Governor Wike said that the posters are from political mischief makers who forgot in their haste that nobody runs for the office of vice president.

“We urge Nigerians to disregard these posters as they have no link with the Rivers State Governor. Nobody runs for the office of the Vice President,” the statement added.

“The governor has the mandate of the good people of Rivers State and he is focused on delivering quality projects and programmes for the people.

“Governor Wike will not be distracted by the antics of misguided politicians who want to mislead Nigerians”.

Wike’s friend and party man, Gov. Ayo Fayose, declared weeks ago he’s running for the party’s ticket for Nigeria’s top position.

His declaration was in spite of the PDP arraignment zoning the ticket to the north.
