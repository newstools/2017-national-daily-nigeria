One person has been reportedly shot in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, as commercial drivers under the auspices of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) staged a violent protest over the alleged detention of their member by Governor Ayodele Fayose.
The protest began on Monday at Ajilosun area, where motorists travelling to Ikere Ekiti from the state capital were held up for several hours as drivers took to the streets over the arraignment and detention of a driver, Mr. Ahmed Kolo, for allegedly being rude to the governor.
The driver, who was said to have driven recklessly on September 24 when the governor personally drove to Ajilosun area in Ado Ekiti, was immediately arraigned at the Ado Ekiti Magistrate’s court for traffic offence.

Despite the assurance by the governor that the driver had been forgiven, members of the union were taken aback that Kolo was arraigned at the magistrate’s court, which prompted the protest.
As the irate commercial vehicle operators made bonfires on Okeyinmi-Ijigbo-Ajilosun road, which made commuters to have a hectic time plying the route, one of the drivers, who craved anonymity, said: “One of us was shot at Ajilosun very close to Fayose market. There is no way we won’t revenge the killing. We are even going to burn down police station if that boy dies.”
