 “As already widely reported, kindly recall that earlier today, Chief Magistrate Mrs. K.B Ayeye, of Magistrate Court 1, Tinubu,  remanded Aminu Abubakar in prison custody for his failure to produce in court one of the children of the broken marriage with client, as ordered by the Honorable Court. However, following his remand in custody, he was compelled to produce the six-year old boy in court late this afternoon,” the Chambers declared.
They maintained that, “Accordingly, Aminu Abubakar was released from custody and our client, Miss Ummi Bolori, has been reunited with her two kids which were forcefully taken from her by Aminu Abubakar four years ago.”
