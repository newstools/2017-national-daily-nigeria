Price of garri, a staple in the country, has dropped by more than 60 per cent in Enugu
within four months.

Newsmen conducted a market survey on the staple on Monday, observed that the price has gone down from as high as N1, 250 to between N450 and N500 per paint bucket.

The paint bucket of four-litre is usually the standard measure for cereals in South East.

Many buyers, who came to purchase garri in the markets in Enugu, said they were happy as they could get white garri for N450 and yellow garri for N500.

A buyer, who spoke to Newsmen, said that they prayed the price could crash further, while another said it should continue at its current price.

The traders attributed the price crash to the current bumper harvest of cassava after many Nigerians had yielded the call to return to the farm.

A garri seller at Garki Market, Mrs Obioma Ukoh, said that many people went into cassava farming since last year and for that its price had drastically dropped.


“I pray that people will continue to plant cassava, this way there will be no reason to buy it as high as N1, 250 again,’’ she said.

Mr James Ugwu, a teacher in one of the secondary schools in Enugu, also said that the low price was as a result of bumper harvest of cassava this year.

Ugwu, who Newsmen met at Kenyatta Market, said that the price would not get higher anymore as everyone had learnt a lesson and many had gone back to farming.

A corps member, Miss Ifeoma Ogbologu, who came for shopping at Akwata Market, said she was happy buying garri at the rate of N450, explaining that it was not easy when the price was N1, 250.
