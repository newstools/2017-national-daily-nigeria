The large number of IPOB members in prisons across Zone E in the southeast has swollen the already bloated population of inmates, and increased the burden of logistics.

Over 100 members of the separatist group are cooped up in various prisons in the zone from where they go to court to face trial for clashing with soldiers during Operation Python Dance in Abia last month.

Alloy Uchenwa, assistant comptroller general in charge of Zone E, comprising of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Bayelsa, Imo and Rivers, with headquarters in Owerri, said this on Thursday in Unuahia.

Uchenwa, who explained that he was in Abia State as part of his routine inspection of facilities in commands under his zone, identified inadequate logistics as one of the major challenges of the prisons and appealed to individuals, organisations and governments to come to the assistance of the zone.

According to him, 90 percent of the inmates are awaiting trialm and cells for 500 are being occupied by 1,000 inmates.

Uchenwa said he had raised the issue of prison congestion with Abia State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Chief Umeh Kalu (SAN), who he said promised to do something.
