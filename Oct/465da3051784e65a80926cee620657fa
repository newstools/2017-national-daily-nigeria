The Advanced People’s Democratic Alliance while acknowledging the efforts of the the present administration in the payment of workers salaries through Paris club refund and bailout funds to states  went on to give categorical reason for Federal Government not to go ahead with its plan to release last tranche of Paris club refund .

Speaking to the press, the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Tosin Adeyanju voiced that “It is unfortunate and unacceptable that despite huge and timely release of these funds no state has been adjudged to have utilised the funds for its primary purpose”

It’s to this end, that APDA enjoins the Federal Government not to accede to any  request for further release of funds until a comprehensive and extensive audit is carried out to determine the true state of affairs in the States especially in the face of the claims and counter claims of the state governments and labour unions.

APDA is equally of the stance that all releases as regards the payment of workers salaries should be done through the IPPIS in states which is in use at the federal level and has recorded astounding success in the timely payment of salaries and identification of ghost workers.

APDA believes that the streamlining of all public sector workers salaries through the IPPIS would greatly reduce public funds wastage as cases of ghost workers has  bedevilled the public sector for a long time.

“We call upon Nigerians to step forward and be counted in our commitment to return our country to the trajectory of prosperity by voting only credible persons into positions of public trust” he concluded.
