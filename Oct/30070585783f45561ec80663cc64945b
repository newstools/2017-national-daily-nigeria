Indigenes of Peremabiri in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State have commended the state Governor, Hon. Seriake Dickson and the State Police Command over the decision to resettle them after about 14 months of displacement due to political crises.

The over 300 displaced indigenes of the community made up of men, women and children, had in 2015 fled from their community following wide spread violence that erupted during the general elections and were camped by the state government.

The displaced indigenes, however, returned to their community last Saturday amid fanfare as they rejoiced and danced applauding the government for all it did for them.

Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, Mr Nigeria Kia, expressed satisfaction for their return to the community.

Kia commended the governor for making it possible for them to return to their various homes.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matter, Mr Boma Spero-Jack, said since 2015, the government of Bayelsa had been responsible for their feeding and accommodation.

“In our days, Peremabiri was known for rice planting, today, I am happy that it will be
exporting it in large quantity. Everyone is happy to go back to their ancestral community after a long time,” he said.

The Bayelsa Commissioner of Police, Mr Amba Asuquo, assured them of safety, adding that the community was now calm.

Asuquo advised them to forget the past as no society could achieve meaningful development under a state of rancour and also urged them to be law abiding and report any suspected cases of violence to the appropriate authority in the
community.
