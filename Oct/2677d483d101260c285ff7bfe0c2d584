Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has pleaded with citizens of the state not to mortgage the gradual peace, which was returning to the state, but to be committed in contributing their quota to overcome the recent setback and be united in the common pursuit of the needed peace in the state.
Lalong equally urged the citizens to be security conscious and desist from all actions or pronoun-cements, especially in the social media, capable of fanning the embers of hatred and discord.
