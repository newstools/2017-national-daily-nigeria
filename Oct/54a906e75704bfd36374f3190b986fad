Jeremiah Olasupo, a motorcyclist, was on Wednesday remanded after he pleaded guilty to a charge of assault.


The 20-year-old commercial motorcyclist, was remanded in prison by an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court.

Olasupo was said to have beaten up a man for reporting him to the police over allegation of attempted rape of the complainant’s salesgirls.

As a result, the accused was arraigned on a three-count charge of breach of peace, assault and attempted rape.

The Magistrate, Mrs Y.O. Ekogbulu, said the accused should be kept in Kirikiri Prison pending sentence.

Earlier, the Prosecutor, Inspector Clement Okuoimose, told the court that the accused committed the offences on September 19 at Adeyemi Street, Bolade, Oshodi, Lagos.

Okuoimose said the accused with another man still at large conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace at Oshodi.

He explained, “The accused and his accomplice attempted to pull down the door of Adewale Salami’s house in an attempt to rape his salesgirls.

“The accused went to the house the complainant rented for his two salesgirls at 2am and was banging the door, commanding the girls to open.

“When the girls refused to open the door, the accused was trying to pull down the gate in order to gain entry and the girls started shouting while the accused left.

“The following morning, one of the girls who recognised the accused told the complainant and when he reported the case to the police, the accused stormed his house and beat him up,’’ he said.

Even though the accused, pleaded guilty to the charge but asked for mercy, it was learnt that a section of the law prescribes 14 years imprisonment for rape.

Magistrate Ekogbulu, fixes October 6 for sentence.
