Tottenham and Liverpool really have no hiding place, just running pace. The big guns have their triggers set over them. So much so, that by the January opening, the English clubs may gasp for breathe as they watch their icons exit.
Bayern Munich wants the new symbol of Liverpool’s found movement. Just when they thought it’s high time they basked in the conquest of retaining Coutinho from the drag away claws of Barca.

Bayern wants Jurgen Klopp.

Real Madrid wants Harry Kane, and this is diff from how Barca wants Cout. To start with Madrid are willing to start the bidding from €200m.  How you know the soccer financial thermometer is seriously tampered, Kane will be €110m more expensive than Bale.

Well when that move happens, the Spurs would have to rely on a loan deal of Andre Gomez. What they couldn’t achieve with 30+ goals in seasons, they’d attempt to do so with a Barca reject and the Wembley curse.

There’s a theory in the air. You can call it a rumor or comfortably name it a possible exchange in chain effect: that Man United will get Mesut Ozil if Wenger gets Draxler.

Should Arsenal fans still be hopeful? Knowing Man City also has its eyes on Alexis Sanchez?

Chelsea hopes getting a £60m Juventus left-back Alex Sandro and Alexis Sánchez would help appease Conte who  Should Arsenal be hopeful?

Koeman will help Atletico Madrid solve their forward surpluses that has awaiting Costa. In doing that Everton will bid for Gameiro as they hope to solve their own very glaring problems too.
They also want Theo Walcott. I ask again, Arsenal what’s the hope?
