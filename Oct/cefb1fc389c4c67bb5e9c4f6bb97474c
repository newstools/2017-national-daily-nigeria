Former Governor of Delta State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, has described the death of Pa Johnson Oritsegbubemi Sunday (J O S) Ayomike, as a great loss to the Itsekiri nation, including His Royal Majesty, Olu of Warri, Delta State and Nigeria.
Uduaghan, in a statement signed by his media aide, Sunny Areh, is thankful that J O S Ayomike’s deep knowledge of the historical perspectives of the Itsekiri people are well recorded and preserved for generations unborn.
Uduaghan, while reacting, on Thursday, to the death of Ayomike, Nigeria’s foremost historian and erstwhile Chairman of the Itsekiri Leaders of Thought, revealed that the deceased freely gave him wise counsel as Governor.

“As the elder brother of my late mother-in-law, he easily accepted me into the Ayomike family and was a father figure in the early years of our marriage,” the statement read.
“You may not agree with him always, but his counsel were invaluable. His forthrightness can unnerve sometimes but there was always a take-away.
“At his advanced age, he always found time and means to get across to me to deliver his well-articulated positions on issues that agitated his mind.
“We will miss a father and a leader who preached and towed the path of peace always. We will miss the Itsekiri historian with an uncommon gift and insight into how neighbours can live peacefully without rancour.”
While condoling with the immediate family of Pa Ayomike and the Itsekiri nation for the great loss, Dr. Uduaghan prayed for the peaceful repose of his soul and advised that his deeds should be preserved and emulated.
