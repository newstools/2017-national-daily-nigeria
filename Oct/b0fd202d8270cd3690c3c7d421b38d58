Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola revealed he was disappointed that Barcelona were made to play Las Palmas behind closed doors on Sunday.
The game went on amidst violence and police clashes, because of the referendum on Catalan independence.
Guardiola, who spent 17 years at Barca as a player, before managing the club between 2008 and 2012, has also played seven times for Catalunya.

When asked about the match, which the Camp Nou outfit won 3-0, he told Catalunya Radio: “The Barca-Las Palmas game? I would not have played it at all.
“If you finally play that game, if you play, it’s done with the public, with all the consequences.”
