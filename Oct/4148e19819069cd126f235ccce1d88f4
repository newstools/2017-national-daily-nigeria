The former Aviation Minister, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, has said he attended the launch of Governor Fayose’s Presidential bid despite all odds, criticism from some quarters because the Ekiti State Governor stands for the downtrodden, fearless and speaks the truth at all times.

Fani-Kayode stated in Abuja that Fayose and himself, moves in the prophetic guided by the spirit of God, adding that the spirit of David and Jehu runs through both of them.

He explained, “I stood with Governor Ayodele Fayose because, unlike most, he has immense courage.

“We come from completely different backgrounds and we do not agree on everything but we have a similar disposition and we share the same perspective on most things.

“He is not bound up in fear and he is not chained down by political correctness; he speaks the raw and bitter truth and he stands up for the weak and the defenceless.

“Like me, he moves in the prophetic and his source of strength is the Spirit and power of God; we both love God and we are both men of strength, courage, faith and destiny.

“The Spirit of David and Jehu runs through both of us and we neither fear death nor incarceration and we hate injustice, evil and oppression.

“The truth is that he has done an excellent job in his Ekiti State and he has consistently and fearlessly stood against the evil of the Buhari administration and constantly kept them on their toes.

“He is a Yorubaman who has the courage and conviction to say that he wants to be President; why would I not stand with him and attend the launching of his campaign?

“I believe that he would make an excellent President and effect the necessary changes and restructuring that our country desperately needs.

“I am very proud of Ayo Fayose and I never desert or abandon my friends: He is and will always be my friend and brother”, Fani-Kayode concluded.
