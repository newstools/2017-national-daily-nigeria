Former Oil Minister Diezani Allison-Madueke has forfeited property worth N3 billion to the federal government following a court order.

A Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered the final forfeiture of the assets, according to Channels Television.

The order followed the ruling on an application the EFCC brought before the court.

Mrs. Alison-Madueke is currently in the UK where she is also being investigated for money laundering.

She has also filed a suit compelling the court to irder the federal government to bring her back home to defend herself in a string of allegations involving her and her associates.
