The Rotary Club of Ajuwon has made a donation of half a million naira worth of books, to the Lagos State Public Library Meiran in an attempt to bolster literacy in the area.

Making the donation to mark the Rotary Monthly Focus tag ‘Basic Literacy and Education Month’, President Rotary Club of Ajuwon Rotarian Oladehinde Kofoworola and the District Chairman Rotarian Babarinde Aderemi stated that a literate mind is a liberated mind, harping the importance of literacy.

According to Oladehinde,education is a great legacy that has brought a lot of improvement to our society and we will be doing ourselves a lot of disservice if we fail to invest massively to our literacy aiding platforms.

“We are made strong through the pedagogic capabilities inculcated in us in our school days, at least today we can stand independently and assert relevant views on topical issues having read and still reading quite a lot, because a reader they say is a leader.

“We want the beneficiary to make judicious use of this instructional materials for the good of all those frequenting this library and for the community”. Said Rotarian Oladehinde.

Responding to the kind gesture of the Ajuwon rotary club, the CEO and Chairman of the Library board, Mr Lawal, appraised the antecedents of the club citing the new one as an added cap, stated the poise of the board to judiciously manage the material.

“We are aware about the great feats recorded  by your club all over the State and worldwide,we want to pledge our preparedness to ensure a judicious use of the materials afforded us geared towards evolving a literate society, we appreciate this gesture so much”.

The programme also witnessed a tree planting exercise, performed by the Rotary club President and the vice Rotarian Ogunsanwo Adedayo.
