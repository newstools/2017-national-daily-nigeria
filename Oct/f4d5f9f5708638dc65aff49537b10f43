Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs is quite pleased with the fight between Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial for a spot in the starting XI.

Rashford has started six league matches this season, however, five goals from Martial in all competitions has seen him play both UCL games.

The young England international has stated his battle for a spot in the team with his France counterpart has helped him improve his game.

And Giggs is of a mind that both players can feature in the same team, with Rashford playing a central role , but will like to see them become prolific before that happens.

“The battle between Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial has been great to follow,” Giggs said to Sky Sports.

“I could definitely see them in the same team, with Marcus being more of a natural centre-forward whereas Martial is more of a left-sided forward but can also play centrally.
“They have got incredible pace so they are extremely dangerous, although to be considered top players they need to be scoring 20 goals a season.”
