The police on Friday arraigned 18-year-old old house keeper, Patience Ejebong in an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State over theft of her employers jewelries worth N3.5 million.
Patience was arraigned alongside an alleged accomplice, Timothy Uteng, 31, on two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing.
The prosecuting officer, Sgt. Samuel Mishozunnu, told the court that the defendants and others at large committed the offences in July at Plot 511, Unit 2, Lekki Gardens Phase 2, Ajah, Lagos.
He said the defendants conspired and stole a gold watch, three bottles of designer perfume and a gold necklace.
Mishozunnu, who said the items were valued at N3.6 million, belonged to the complainant, Mrs Akin grade Oluwatosin.

According to the prosecuting officer, the offences contravene sections 287 (7) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The duo, however, denied any involvement in the crimes and filed oral application for bail, arguing that the alleged offences were bailable.
They also argued that the prosecution team was yet to prove to the court that they actually stole the items.
The defendants vowed to be in court to stand justice if admitted to bail.
The prosecuting officer, who did not object the application, however, added that bail was at the discretion of the court.
The Magistrate, Mrs O. O. Otitoju, therefore, granted the applicants bail in the sum of N500,000 each with two sureties each in like sum.
She said the sureties must be gainfully employed and must show evidence of tax payment to Lagos State Government and adjourned the case until Oct. 25 for mention.
