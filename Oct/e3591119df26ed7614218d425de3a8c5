“Some of the revenue also came from property tax, pools and lottery, levies and also from registration and other miscellaneous collection,’’ he said.
Adeosun explained that the achievement recorded in the area of huge revenue collection could be attributed to regular tax education and enlightenment of the public by the state government
According to him, the enumeration of existing and potential tax payers also contributed significantly to the success recorded.
“We do not have any interference from the governor of the state on the issue of tax collection which has significantly contributed to the success of OGIRS in its aggressive revenue drive.
“It could also be attributed to collaboration and exchange of information with Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and aggressive tax drive within the confine of the law.
