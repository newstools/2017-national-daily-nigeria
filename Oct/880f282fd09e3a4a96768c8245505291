The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday denied a story circulating on the social media that they stormed the basement of the Ikeja, Lagos residence of Senator Ibikunle Amosun, governor of Ogun State, where cash in local and foreign currencies were said to have been stashed in a vault.

Wilson Uwujaren, spokesperson of the agency, said in a statement in Abuja debunked the report quoting ghost sources in the Commission which further alleged that the Commission had been on the trail of the governor for two weeks before the purported raid.

“It is important to state that there is no truth in the report. Governor Amosun was neither under surveillance nor was any of his residence raided by operatives of the EFCC,” he stated.



He, therefore, appealed to members of the public to disregard the false report.
