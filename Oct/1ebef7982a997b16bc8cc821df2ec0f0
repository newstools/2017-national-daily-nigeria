Cross River State governor, Senator Ben Ayade, has enjoined Cross Riverians and indeed,  Nigerians to be patient and hopeful, as the country would surely surmount her challenges.
Ayade made the call in his goodwill message to the people of the state on the occasion of the Nigerian’s 57th independence anniversary.
The governor noted that despite the myriads of challenges that have confronted Nigeria in recent times, the country has, however, made some giant strides in her march towards greatness .
Ayade said with the kind of leadership, as currently headed by President Mohammadu Buhari,  the country would definitely bounce back to reclaim its status as a true giant of Africa.

The governor who used the occasion to reiterate the commitment of his administration to deliver on all his campaign promises to the people of the state said: “Despite the harsh realities of the times, the state has no doubt witnessed rapid progress with the massive construction of industries currently going on across the state.”
According to the governor, “In a couple of months, the ultra-modern rice mill in Ogoja, the state of the art  Cocoa processing plant in Ikom, the Calabar Pharmaceutical company (Calapharm) and the Rice City in Calabar will be up and running. Also, a couple of strategic road infrastructure are currently under construction across the state. All these are geared towards recaliberating the economic architecture of our dear state.”
While suing for patience, Governor Ayade said: “You have been patient with us and all I can ask from you at this crucial time, is a little more patience, a positive attitude and your prayer and understanding as we strive to earn your trust by fulfilling our promises to you.”
