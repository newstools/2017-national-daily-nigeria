Media magnate and PDP stalwart Raymond Dokpesi has said that his corruption trial won’t hinder him from contesting and winning his party chairmanship.

Dokpesi is being prosecuted by the EFCC for receiving N2.1 billion from ex-NSA Dasuki Sambo in the run-up to the 2015 elections which the then ruling party under former President Jonathan lost.

Dokpesi, who addressed journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, also revealed that at the peak of the party’s crisis, the Ahmed Makarfi-led faction formed the Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance, APDA, as plan B in case they lost out in the power tussle.

For the party chairmanship, the businessman said he is up to the mark.

“The national convention zoned the position of the national chairman to the South and zoned the presidency to the North. And there is no micro-zoning; the convention would have said it is zoning to the South West, but the convention in its wisdom did not do so.

“I take full responsibility for the roles I played in the formation and funding of APDA. It was set up as a plan B for the PDP at the peak of its internal crisis.

According to him, he respects the elders of this party, and the PDP constituted authority.

“ But they are human beings,” he added.
