Commiserates With Sports Minister over wife’s demise 




The Director General of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside has commended the leadership of Senate for appointing Senator Magnus Abe as the Senate Committee Chairman on Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA).
Dr Peterside, who stated this in a chat with newsmen at the Port Harcourt International Airport last weekend, said Senator Magnus Abe’s appointment is a testimony of his industry, managerial acumen and willingness to expand frontiers of democracy beyond rhetoric.
According to him, “the people of Rivers South East and indeed the state will now see what representation is all about. We all know what Senator Abe can do, he has been there before and his records are still unmatched. We, in the Rivers South East remain proud of him.”
The NIMASA boss expressed delight that the Senate appointment is coming barely one month after Abe was re-elected to represent the people of Rivers South East in the National Assembly.
“I have always said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State has men of character, integrity and sense responsibility. Senator Abe is one man you can be sure to perform any task given to him to the best of his ability,” he stressed.
Meanwhile, Dr Dakuku Peterside has sympathized with the Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung over the demise of his first wife, Ruth Dalung.
He stated that the sad loss of Mrs Ruth Dalung came at a time when her husband is on national duty where he is working with President Muhammadu Buhari to restore the glory and prosperity of Nigeria.
He prayed for the repose of her soul, just as he called on the Sports Minister to bear the irreparable loss with strength and perseverance required in losing a loved one.
