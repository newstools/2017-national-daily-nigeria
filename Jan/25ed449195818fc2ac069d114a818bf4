Several teachers in public primary and Junior Secondary Schools in Kwara say they have embarked on fasting and prayer to ensure payment of their six months’ salary arrears by state government.
The Deputy Chairman of the state chapter of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Alhaji Toyin Salihu, disclosed this in llorin on Monday, January 9, 2017.
Salihu, who also the Principal of Sheikh AbdulKadir College, llorin, said that the teachers’ action was for God’s intervention for the payment of their salary arrears.
He said that though the fasting and prayers were voluntary for both Christians and Muslim teachers, it would continue until God accepts their request.
The NUT Deputy Chairman said that the government had commenced full monthly payment for the teachers’ salary, but that they were yet to receive their six months’ salary arrears.
Salihu said that the unpaid six months arrears had added to the untold hardship being experienced by the teachers and their relations.
