Deputy National Chairman, South, of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) Ashiwaju Segun Oni, has affirmed that efforts to form a mega party ahead of the 2019 general elections will not work in Nigeria.
Oni, who said this in Abuja on Wednesday, affirmed that the ruling APC would produce the next governor of Ekiti State.
There were reports earlier that some aggrieved members of the party were planning to form a mega party with the aim of ousting the APC from power in 2019.
Oni said, “We have always been saying it; this is a party that is going to turn Nigeria around completely.
“Any attempt to form any mega party, we can predict clearly, will end up in failure. This is the party that will turn Nigeria around, and we are prepared, we are prepared.
“If the PDP dies, there will be another opposition party. So, we are not saying that the PDP will not come back, we are saying, don’t call whatever political party that is coming a mega party, it cannot be bigger than the APC.”
Speaking on the state of the economy, the party chieftain assured Nigerians that the economy would get better in 2017 to demonstrate what he described as the ‘human face’ of the APC.
He stressed that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration had been making efforts to encourage state governments to pay workers’ salaries through the release of bailout to the states.
“Ekiti people should expect a government that will be different from Ayo Fayose’s and that will come from our party because it is not going to be Fayose’s party again, it should be our party.
“Our party should produce the next governor, that is our prayer, that is our hope and that is the hope of everybody on the street”, he added.
