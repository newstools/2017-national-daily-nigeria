Over 400 witnesses are expected to testify for the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu at the ongoing hearing of the petition against the victory of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State in the September 28 governorship election.
Some witnesses who testified before the three-man panel insisted that there were no accreditation before voting at their various polling units.
