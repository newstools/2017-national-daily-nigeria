Demands N27. 5m rent from Commission




Ekiti State Government under the leadership of Governor Ayodele Peter Fayose has ordered the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to vacate its state command headquarters located along Afao Road with immediate effect or pay an accumulated rent of N27.5million to government coffers within 5days.
The state government during the administration of Chief Segun Oni allocated the facility to the NSCDC in 2010 to ease the accommodation problems faced by the security agency and other federal government institutions.
The same policy was sustained by the administration of Dr Kayode Fayemi which allowed the NSCDC and other sister federal government agencies to utilise the complex which had been hitherto abandoned.
The complex was initially constructed by the Fayose during his first stint in office and was commissioned by former President Olusegun Obasanjo but was abandoned after Fayose was impeached from office in 2006.
In a bid to put them into functional use, Oni allocated the buildings to federal government parastatals some of which included National Population Commission (NPC), National Orientation Agency (NOA), National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), among others since Ekiti is yet to have a Federal Secretariat.
The Command Headquarters was allocated to the Corps in 2010 when Engr Segun Oni was Governor and was sustained by the successive leadership of Dr Kayode Fayemi.
