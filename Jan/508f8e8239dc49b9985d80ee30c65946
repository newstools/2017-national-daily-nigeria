Gen Irabor disclosed that apart from some civilians, two humanitarian workers from the International Committee on Red Cross (ICRC) and Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) were wounded in the incident.
In addition, two soldiers were also wounded, noting that the wounded have been evacuated.
National Daily further gathered that the military was mute on whether it was it was an tactical or operational error or not.
Worried by the incident, the military could not immediately give the exact figure of causality killed in the airstrike, adding that the death of innocent person in the course of operation was rather disturbing to the military authority and the institution.

He condoles with families of the dead, and wished the wounded divine succour, leading to full recovery.
