For engaging in reckless alcohol drinking spree and unable to pay the accumulated bill, an Apapa Magistrate Court sitting in Lagos has remanded one James Hamed, 28,
musician in prison custody for allegedly unpaid consumption of beer worth N10.000
James Hamed  (aka T-Money ) was said to have hosted his friends and other guest at a restaurant in Ajegunle area of Lagos.
The incident happened at No 10, Taiwo Street in Ajegunle area of Olodi
Apapa where the complainant, Mrs Monsurat Ademola runs a restaurant.
National Daily gathered that Hamed, who is in Kirikiri prison, took his friends to Ademola’s restaurant and ordered drinks for them, after they had finished drinking, he wanted to leave without asking for the bill which was put at N10,000.
it was further learnt that when the owner of the restaurant reminded him that he had not paid his bill, he was said to have told her that he has run out cash but promised to pay later when he would have raised money.
Ademola refused and held saying that she did not buy the drinks on credit and turned down his credit request considering that he did not tell her before he ordered for the drinks.
National Daily later gathered that the refusal to let him led to exchange of words between complainant and Hamed. The woman was said to have contacted the police who arrested him.
He was subsequently charged to court while he pleaded not guilty. However, the presiding magistrate, M.A. Etti, granted him bail in the sum of N50, 000 with one surety.
Hamed was remanded in prison pending when he will perfect his bail condition while the case was adjourned to next week.
