The Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice; Mr. Adeniji Kazeem, hosts The 2017 Ministry of Justice Stakeholders Summit, Theme: Contemporary Trends: Catalysts for Justice Sector Reform in Lagos State,
The 3-Days Summit is an attempt by the Ministry and by extension, this government, to create a platform for all stakeholders in the justice sector to come together to proffer solutions to areas identified as requiring improvement within the sector.
The HAG in his remark said, “By this Summit, we intend to create a platform for exchange of knowledge and ideas and it is expected that the Summit will feature about 25 high level speakers drawn from within and outside the country.”
“No doubt you are aware that Lagos State is the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria. For it to remain so, there is a need to continue to update our laws and policies, in order to create an enabling environment for investors and even tourists. The best way to do this is to get the contributions and participation of stakeholders through a platform such as this.” Kazeem said.
The Sessions planned will consist of Plenary, Panel discussions, a host of interactive deep conversations, as well as lively discussions addressing the most topical themes in Justice Administration. Topics will range from Criminal Administration, to appraisal of Civil Procedure, Ethics and Efficient Court Administration.
