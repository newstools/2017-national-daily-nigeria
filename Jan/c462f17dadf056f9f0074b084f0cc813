Electricity generation in the country has continued to be on downward slide. The national electricity grid was gathered to have lost 728 megawatts in the first 12 days of 2017, after peak power generation dropped to 3,432mw on Thursday.

Available data indicate that the grid started with a peak generation of 4,160mw attained on January 1, 2017 with the lowest generation at 3,366mw. 

The generation was consistent for about four days before the decline set in, data available at the Nigeria System Operator (NSO) website revealed.

The federal capital territory and neighbouring states like Niger and Nasarawa were the most beneficiaries of the improved electricity generation in the recent months but the current figure shows that the capacity of the generating companies is becoming weaker.
