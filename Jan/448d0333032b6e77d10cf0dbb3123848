The Three- day warning strike called by the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas (NUPENG) to protest alleged unfriendly labour practices and lack of implementation of agreements by oil companies in the country has been suspended.
Also, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has warned that the government will not accept a situation where oil companies disregard agreements freely entered into with labour unions.
This was the outcome of a meeting called by the minister between the unions and the international oil companies on Wednesday.
The meeting was attended by the two unions in the oil sector, representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the Inspector General of Police and the Director General of the Directorate of State Services (DSS).
Addressing journalists at the end of the meeting which finished at about 7.40 p.m., President of NUPENG, Comrade Igwe Achese, said they were satisfied with the commitment shown during the deliberations and expressed hope that the agreement reached will be implemented by all parties.
