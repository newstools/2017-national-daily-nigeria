The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), has reiterated it earlier directives to men and officers of the commission in the various command across the country to henceforth desist from booking motorists for Fire Extinguisher, Caution sign and Light sign violations.
In a circular, signed by Deputy Corp Marshal Ojemeh Ewhoudjakgor and titled: Suspension of Booking of Fire Extinguisher, Light Sign Violation and Caution Sign: Further Directives, it said “Recall that there was a directive from DCM (Operations) for commands to suspend booking of Fire Extinguisher Violation (FEV, Caution Sign Violation (CSV) and Light Sign Violation (LSV) via circulars reference ‘B’ and ‘C” above, traffic offenders are still being booked for these three offences.”
The circular with reference number FRSC/HQ/OPS/95/Vol.11/103 and dated December 27, 2016 therefore  reiterated that traffic offenders apprehended for any of the aforementioned offences should be enlightened without booking unless at night with the booking of Light Sign Violation.
