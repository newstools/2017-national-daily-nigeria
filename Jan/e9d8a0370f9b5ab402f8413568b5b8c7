Caleb University is a private university located in Imota, Lagos Nigeria. The school is renowned for its discipline and high academic status. It is also known to be really strict with its students when it came to paying attention to rules and regulations. Recently the university caused a stir after employing a certain stringent measure to make sure that students complied with a law that says male students must wear a low hair cut within the campus premises. According to a student who shared the story on the social media, barbers were seen stationed at the school gate to make sure that all students who came back from the hols without adhering to the low-cut rule get shaved.
