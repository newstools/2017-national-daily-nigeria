The Senator representing Kogi West at the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly, has boasted that nobody can intimidate him in the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Dino made the statement at Ayetoro-Gbede, his country home, over the weekend.
According to him, “There are so many unnecessary comments and rhetoric going around. As far as APC is concerned, whether at the national or state level, we are in charge. I am not boasting.
“Kogi State governor cannot underrate me; neither can anybody underrate me in APC. I say this with every sense of responsibility and humility.
“I am the only member of the board of trustees of APC in Kogi State; even the Governor is not a member. I am also a member of the executive council of APC.”
The Senator representing Kogi West, Senator Dino Melaye recently lamented the continued delay in the replacement of the Kogi State Ministerial slot after the demise of the late Minister of State for Employment, Labour and Productivity, James Ocholi, SAN.
The Kogi Senator, however, threatened to carry out what he called “alternative measures” if President Buhari failed to make the replacement as soon as possible.
