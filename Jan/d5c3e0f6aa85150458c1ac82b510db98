The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Kwara state says it had discovered a warehouse in Ilorin, where 4.336 tons of cannabis sativa were allegedly kept.
Reuben Apeh, the agency’s state commander, speaking to journalists, said the incident happened at Osere area along Asa Dam road in Illorin.
He said no arrest was made.
“We are still doing the best we could to ensure that the culprits do not go out of hands, we are still trailing them,” he said.
Apeh also said the NDLEA’s operatives made the seizure on January 9, following a tip off from the public.
“The seizure was a great relief to humanity considering the effects the use of such drugs could have on the socioeconomic development of the state and Nigeria as a whole.
“Cannabis sativa is a very highly controlled drug not only in Nigeria, its effects is synonymous with cocaine,” he said.
