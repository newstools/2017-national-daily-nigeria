For talk show host and broadcaster, Funmi Iyanda, marriage is not meant for her. Iyanda revealed this via series of tweets to confirm that marriage is not her priority.
The host of the defunct New Dawn, on Wednesday, took to Twitter to state that she’s not the “marrying type.”
Sharing her experience with a psychic, she tweeted: “I had my palm and tarot card reading done yesterday, 1st time.
Psychic says l am not the marrying type. I want my money back.”
Her tweet prompted comments of support from well-wishers, who prayed that she would get married.
In response, Iyanda further tweeted: “Oh for goodness’ sake. Stop texting me prayers. This means he told me what l always knew. Jeez! So many fried brains.”
She added: “I have never wanted to be married. I like it for others who like it for themselves but as for me ms Funmi Iyanda, no, thank you.”
When asked why she’s against marriage, she said, “because marriage is often wielded as a power tool and a repudiation of it seem like a challenge to misguided power notions.”
