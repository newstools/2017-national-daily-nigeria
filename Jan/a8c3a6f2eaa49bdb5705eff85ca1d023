• Confirmation of CJN
By DICKSON OMONODE
By February 3, Supreme Court Justice W. S. Nkanu Onnoghen will be three months old acting as Nigeria’s chief justice. And a day after that, according to section 231, subsection 5 of Nigerian constitution, he may be eased out of the apex court. “Except on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council,” the subsection states in part.
Critics of President Muhammadu Buhari’s government believe the Aso Rock dilly-dallying over the appointment is a grand plan to shut the door of the topmost judicial office in the face of southerners.
Sources close to the council confirmed to the National Daily that while the presidency is getting uneasy about the delay, and may send Onnoghen’s name to the Senate for confirmation, there’s still a move to displace the 66-year-old acting CJN who comes from Rivers. The next most senior justice to him now is Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad.
Of the 14 past CJNs appointed between 1958 and 2014, four were from the southwest, eight from the north, and one, Justice Gabriel Ayo Irikefe, came from the south.
As the Supreme Court is currently constituted, seven of the 17-man court are from the north, four from the southwest, and six from the southeast and south-south.
Part of what makes many believe the presidency has a hidden agenda is that it took no long a time for the former CJN Mohammed Mamhoud to be appointed when his predecessor Justice Aloma Mukthar retired.
Onnoghen will be the first in about seven decades to have remained this long in acting capacity.
