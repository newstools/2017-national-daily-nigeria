Gbenga Daranijo, an ally of Ogun Senator Buruji Kashamu, has blamed Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State for the demolition of a Primary Health Centre under construction in Ijebu Igbo town.
The health facility was being built by Senator kashamu, a member of the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and founder of Omo Ilu Foundation (OIF), his social intervention vehicle.
Daranijo, who is Lagos coordinator of the OIF, claimed aides and officials of the state government supervised the demolition, allegedly executed at Governor Amosun’s behest. Moreover, Babatunde Ipaye, commissioner of health; and Adebayo Adekoya, chairman, Ijebu North Local Government Area, were the two state officials alleged to have overseen the destruction of the health centre. According to Daranijo, “the officials said Senator Kashamu didn’t obtain a permission.
“I don’t know where a good-intentioned citizen must obtain permission to offer social intervention that will benefit the masses. Clearly the governor’s politics is retrograde, parochial and anti-people”, he said.
Daranijo also denied Buruji was flirting with the APC due to his favourable comment about President Muhammadu Buhari.
“He is committed to the PDP, which he has sunk enormous energy and resources into and would not turn its back on it”, Daranijo stated.
Daranijo spoke  during a visit to Segun Adewale, a factional chairman of the PDP in the state.
