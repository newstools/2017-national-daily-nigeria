About 1,000 returning Internally Displaced Persons in Gwoza local government, Borno State, have been receiving free medical treatment from the Nigerian Air Force.
The beneficiaries were housed in the Wakani camp in Gwoza. This is the first intervention by the Nigerian Air Force in Gwoza since itâ€™s liberation.
Air Commodore Harold Onyechi, the Director Humanitarian Services of the Nigerian Air Force, says the medical outreach is a continuous one.
However, there are over 50,000 Internally Displaced Persons living in Gwoza local government, dealing with one ailment or the other which is associated with poor hygiene and living condition in the camps.
The IDPS, mostly elderly people are happy with the efforts of the Air Force which supplements the overstretched resources of the MSF already operating in Gwoza.
The intervention dealt with issues that had to do with eye related problems, deworming of children, general checkup for nursing and pregnant mothers as well as distribution of free mosquito nets.
