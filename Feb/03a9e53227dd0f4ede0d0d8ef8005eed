The Federal Executive Council has approved the revised National Tax Policy.

The approval was made yesterday in Abuja at the FEC meeting.

The policy will see the Value Added Tax on luxury items, like champagne, increasing from the current five per cent, among other changes.

The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, disclosed this to State House correspondents at the end of a meeting of the council presided over by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo.

She was joined at the press conference by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; and the Minister of State, Aviation, Hadi Sirika.

The administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan had in 2014, while unveiling its austerity measures, identified some items that were to be taxed as luxury goods to include champagne, alcoholic beverages, private jets, luxury cars based on engine capacity, and yachts.
