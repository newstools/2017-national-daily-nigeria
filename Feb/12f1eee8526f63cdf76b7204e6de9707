The 2-day training edition is scheduled to hold between June 9 and 10, 2017 to enable the participating journalists’ garner more knowledge and depth of reporting the industry and also equip them with necessary intellectual tools with which to analyze critical issues as it affects the automobile and allied industries.
It would be recalled that the maiden edition of the training workshop was held in Lagos last year in conjunction with Ford Motor Corporation’s Driving Skill For Life (DSFL), making Ford South Africa the major sponsor and facilitator with support from industry stakeholders in the country while Boboye Oyeyemi, Corps Marshal of the Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC) was the special guest of honour.
According to the 2017 NAJA Training and Organising Committee headed by the Vice President of the Association, Mike Ochonma, the rationale for instituting the annual training is to encourage continuous learning among journalists to move them from the level of reporting to analysis and a career building platform for the journalists.
