The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), has recommended a nationwide ban on commercial motorcycles, popularly known as ‘Okada’, in order to reduce accidents on our roads.
The recommendation came as a result of the October Road Traffic Crash, RTC Report, submitted by the Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF.
Oyeyemi said it was necessary for state governments to ban commercial motorcycles because; they are contribute to major fatal road traffic accidents across the country.
“Following the outcome of the analysis, it could be concluded that motorcycle still constitutes serious menace on the nation’s highways.
“Accordingly, improved results could be achieved in the future, if more state governments could consider placing a ban on the use of a motorcycle for commercial purposes.
According to him, commercial motorcycles also facilitate armed robberies, kidnapping and other criminal activities in the country.
“In view of the above, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation should facilitate and encourage state governments to ban the use of motorcycle for commercial purposes.” the Corps Marshal said.
The National Council on Transport in 2014 recommended commercial motorcycles be banned nationwide, so as “to ensure adequate provision of safe and secure means of transportation in the country”.
Commercial motorcycles have been banned from major routes and highways in some major cities across Nigeria.
