Defending his 2017 budget at the House of Representatives, the CNS who gave details of the seizures, explained that the specific quantity of crude oil and diesel stood at 810,725 and 1,078 metric tons respectively.

He said out of the N56.463 billion appropriated for personnel cost in 2016, N49.656bn was released, while the sum of N205.879 million was generated as Internally Generated Revenue and remitted to government via the Treasury Single Account (TSA).
