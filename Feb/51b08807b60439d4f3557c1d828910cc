An Agege Customary Court in Lagos dissolved a 15-year-old marriageon Tuesday over abandonment and not fulfilling marital duties and responsibilities.

Kasoki Olekanma and his wife Ibukun got their prayer granted based on the fact that Ibukun abandoned her husband and her four children.

Phillips Williams, the presiding judge, dissolved the union because “love which is the key ingredient of a valid marriage no longer exists between the couples.

“Consequently, I hereby order that the marriage between Kasoki Olekanma and Ibukun contracted in 2002 stands dissolved.

“The respondent (Ibukun) is hereby ordered to vacate the home of the petitioner, return her bride price and revert to her maiden or other name of her choice,’’ he said.

National Daily gathered that Olekanma, 51, filed the suit accusing the woman of not showing concern about him and the four children.

It was further learnt that Ibukun abandoned the family on February 11, 2013 for an unknown place.

On her part, Ibukun narrated that she had secured a job in Ado Ekiti and left the care of the children to their father.

The man was compelled to file a suit after patiently waiting for three and half years without seeing her.
