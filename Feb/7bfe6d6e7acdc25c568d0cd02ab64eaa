After a long break from the music scene, Abuja-based group, Styl Plus has staged another comeback with a new song ‘Aso Ibora’.
Notwithstanding the fact that the group is now down to two members [Sunky and Zeal] after Tunde’s decision to go solo, the group still dazzle with the magic Styl Plus is known for.
The track Aso Ibora produced by Blaq Jerzee has been released just in time for Valentine and may be the ultimate comeback track for Styl Plus.
