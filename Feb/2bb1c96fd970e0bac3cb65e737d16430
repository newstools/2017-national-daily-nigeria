The Nigerian Customs Service has declared wanted two officers who allegedly examined and cleared the container which contained 661 ammunition at the Apapa port, Lagos State.
It was learnt that the officers, Abdullahi I, with service number 44483 ASC, and Odiba Haruna Inah, with service number 133386, fled after the weapons were uncovered by the operatives of the Federal Operations Unit, Zone A, Ikeja.
However, three suspects – Oscar Okafor (importer), Mahmud Hassan (clearing agent) and Sadique Mustapha (escort) – in connection with the arms smuggling have been arrested.
The agency explained that some other customs officers were arrested, adding that investigations were ongoing.
