There is no Islamization agenda – Lai Mohammed

Minister of Transport, Rt Hon Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, has denied that President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC, promised to fix Nigeria’s problems within a year.
He accused the National Assembly of holding the Buhari government back from fixing infrastructure problems with their failure to approve its borrowing plan.
He said Nigerians knew who to hold if the current government failed to achieve its policies targeted to better their lives.
Amaechi spoke in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital on Monday during a north central town hall meeting ‎for the people of Kogi, Niger and Kwara organized by the federal government.
“We did not promise you that those challenges will be solved in one year, if we promise you that those challenges would be solved in one year you would have given us one year but you gave us four years mandate, so wait till the end of four years,” Amaechi said.
Amaechi added that the failure of the National Assembly to approve the Federal Government’s borrowing plan from China was holding the government back‎ urging the people from the three states to prevail on the National Assembly to approve the loan.
He said the loan, if accessed would enable the Federal Government to embark on the revitalization of rail projects which would create more jobs for Nigerians.
Speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed cautioned those alleging the Federal Government of attempting to Islamise Nigeria and describing it as; “the most dangerous state for Christians to live “as doing dis-service to Nigeria.”
He noted that such statement coming from religious leaders and being reported in some sections of local and international media were false and should be disregarded.
