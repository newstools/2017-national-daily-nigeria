Former police officers – Awodeyi Adesola, Adekunle Adedeji and Adepetu Olamilekan – have been arraigned before an Akure High Court for manslaughter. The trio were alleged to have tortured a suspect, Oluwatobi Badmus, to death while in their custody.
Badmus’ death led to the dismissal of the three accused from the Nigeria Police Force. Badmus had been accused of stealing a BlackBerry phone belonging to one Bisi Adejuyigbagbe, the reason for his arrest, torture and eventual death in custody on July 21, 2016.
Wale Bamisile, the prosecutor, said the offence contravened Section 317 and Punishable under Section 325 of the Criminal Code Cap 37, Vol.1 Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006.
