Avram Grant has quit his role as Ghana coach after failing to win a medal at the recently concluded 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. The Israeli spent two years in charge of the Black Stars. He said he had met with Ghana FA president Kwesi Nyantakyi and informed him of his intention to leave.
“I’ve hugely enjoyed my time in Ghana taking over after the disastrous 2014 World Cup campaign and rebuilding the squad to reach the final in the African Cup of Nations for only the second time in 23 years, and also the semi-final of this year’s competition,” he said.
“And the passion and loyalty of the supporters is something I’ll always remember.”
Grant led Ghana to the Nations Cup final in 2015 losing the trophy to Cote d’Ivoire. He also led the team to the semi-finals of the tournament in Gabon. The team lost the bronze medal to Burkina Faso.
