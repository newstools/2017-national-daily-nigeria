Not trying to start anything, but this Land Cruiser looks very similar to the one Tonto Dikeh got as a present from her hubby last year and if anything, Tonto Dikeh’s husband – Churchill notorious for his penchant for Toyota SUV products, am not trying to overwork my head here, but yay!!! congrats Rosaline, she claimed she got the car with her whole life savings – who else does not believe this?
