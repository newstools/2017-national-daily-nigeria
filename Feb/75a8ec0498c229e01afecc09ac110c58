From Adewumi Ademiju, Ado Ekiti

An Ado Ekiti High Court has jailed a 45-year-old commercial driver, Lawrence Adedapo, for seven years for raping an 80-year-old woman, Madam Grace Asaolu.

Justice Dele Omotoso convicted Adedapo based on evidence before the court which showed that the driver forcefully had a carnal knowledge of the old woman and was guilty as charged.

The convict sexually assaulted the octogenarian on 7th November, 2013 at Oke Erimope Street, Ogbese, Ise-Ekiti and was subsequently charged to court.

In the course of the trial, Adedapo pleaded not guilty to the charge and gave evidence in his own defence but called no witness.

In his testimony, Adedapo who described the old woman as his “mother as well as his concubine” whom he has been dating as far back as his bachelor years claimed that Mrs. Asaolu framed him up.

He claimed that the old woman had earlier approached him for a sum of money to travel to her village but on that date, she walked into his room and demanded for the money.

The driver claimed that the old woman started romancing him which eventually led to a sexual intercourse after he had given her N1,000.

The prosecution led by the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Owoseni Ajayi, gave evidence that the convict confessed to have been dating the woman before the incident and that she consented to the sexual intercourse.

Ajayi tendered the blood-stained clothes of the victim which was recovered from the scene of the incident.

The trial judge resolved all issues for determination against Adedapo and consequently sentenced him to a jail term of seven years for unlawfully carnal knowledge of the old woman.
