The abductors of five workers of the Eliasa Livestock Farm and two members of Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) have slashed their demand for ransom to N50 million before the victims would be released.

The gunmen kidnapped the victims  on Tuesday in the Igbodu area of Epe while on duty.
National Daily gathered that the gunmen used the phone of one of the victim to contact the manager of the farm yesterday, demanding  N50 million as a precondition before they would release the seven victims.

However, the Assistant Inspector General of Police Zone 2 command, Mr. Kayode Aderanti, said efforts are being made to rescue the victims unhurt even though he did not clear the air about the ransom being demanded.

“We are doing everything to ensure the area is well policed because the major problem in that part of the state is that the area is porous. It gives room for kidnapping to thrive,” he said.

National Daily gathered that about  15 gunmen, who were dressed in military camouflage stormed the farm situated along Ishiwo road at about 7am on Tuesday. They abducted the two members Odua Peoples’ Congress (OPC) who worked as security guards on the farm and five other workers.
