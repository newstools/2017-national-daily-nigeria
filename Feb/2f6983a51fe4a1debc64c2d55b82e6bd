Ruler of the Vatican in Rome, Pope Francis has come under serious criticisms from cardinals openly defying the pope to anonymous posters sullying his name.

The attack was apparently stirred by a statement released by a group of powerful Princes of the Church defending Pope Francis.

But religious watchers warn the move could backfire and work in the favour of his conservative challengers.

“No pope controls everything,” said Vatican expert Luigi Accattoli. “There has always been some resistance, even from cardinals.”

But this time the critics are “louder and more numerous”.

Pope Francis has been accused by conservative cardinals of sowing confusion in regards to family guidelines, specifically regarding divorce play

Pope Francis has been accused by conservative cardinals of sowing confusion in regards to family guidelines, specifically regarding divorce.

The root of the row lies with the Argentine pontiff’s calls for the church to be more understanding towards those it considers “sinners”, and in particular his intimation last year that some believers who have divorced and remarried should be able to take communion.

Traditionalists were horrified; Roman Catholic marriage is for life, so divorcing your first partner for whatever reason and marrying someone else is considered adultery.

Four conservative cardinals accused the pope of sowing confusion and demanded an answer to “doubts” about family guidelines Francis published in April.
