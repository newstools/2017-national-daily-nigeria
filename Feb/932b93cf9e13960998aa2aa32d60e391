Elijah Oyebode, the driver was said to have killed the victim on 2nd of December, 2016 when she boarded his taxi.
National Daily learnt that the victim who had boarded the suspect taxi was hypnotised before she was murdered for rituals by the suspect.
The driver, who confessed to the crime explained that her intention was not to kill her rather play with the young girl only to realised that she died in the process.
Elijah further added that, “She boarded my vehicle at Ipetu-Ijesa back home. She was very nice and friendly. We discussed on varying issues, I never knew she was even a student. I eventually took her to my house in Iragbiji. I never intended to kill her. The devil caused it.”
On how the suspect was arrested, CP Adeoye pointed out that the synergy between police and the Department of State Security aided his arrest and investigation into the murder.
