With the visit of Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and his predecessor, Emmanuel Uduaghan, the Oghara home of former Governor James Ibori became a beehive of activities on Sunday.

Ibori, who served a jail term in London for money laundering, returned to the country on Saturday.

Others who visited are Deputy Governor Kinsley Otuaro, Senator James Manager, Ibori’s former deputy Benjamin Elue, and a former commissioner, Prof. Godwin Darah.

Uduaghan arrived at Ibori’s expansive Villa at about 3:30pm. He was joined by Okowa at about 4:15pm.

Access into the house was restricted to reporters.

Although sources suggested there was a closed-door meeting between Ibori and Okowa/Uduaghan, others at the residence said there was no special meeting as all guests were seated in the living room exchanging banters.

“I was there and I can tell you that there was no special meeting. They were all there privately,” a source said.

As at the time of filing this report at 6pm, the governor’s entourage was still at Oghara.
