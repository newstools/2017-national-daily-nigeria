As early as 8:00am, Ibori’s supporters and some state government officials, who was said to have been led by the Secretary to the State Government, (SSG) Mr. Festus Ovie Agas, and waited at the Osubi Airstrip for him.
However, the former governor arrived at the Benin Airport at about 2:30 pm on a chartered private jet and was driven in an unmarked black SUV car to Oghara about 3:30 pm.
