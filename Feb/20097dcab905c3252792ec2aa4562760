The Department of State Security (DSS) has arrested five “notorious” kidnappers in Cross River State.
The Director of DSS, Cross River Command, Mr. Fubara Duke, stated this on Thursday in Calabar while briefing newsmen on the activities of the command in the last five months.
Duke disclosed that some of the suspects are currently facing trial in court even as others still under investigation have confessed to the crimes.
Describing the activities of the militants groups in the state as “very deadly and dangerous”, the DSS boss added that the command was in synergy with the “Operation Delta Safe’’  to cope the activities of the “deadly” Bakassi Strike Force (BSF).
According to him, “We are working in synergy with other security agencies; we are not sleeping; and we are hopeful that the process will soon be completed and their activities will come to an end.
“Quite a number of this boys have been arrested and we are hopeful that very soon, the peace of the state will be restored,”.
Speaking on the incessant communal clashes in the state, he said that, “We engage the traditional leaders and opinion leaders in those warring communities and we talk to them on the need to end the crisis in their communities.
“We believe that this approach is better than open confrontation and it is yielding results,”.
While charging the media to desist from promoting issues capable of steering division in the country, Duke advised religious leaders and politicians in the state to shun controversial statements that could cause national crisis.
“The media should always ensure objectivity in their reportage of national events because the unity of the country should be paramount”, he said.
